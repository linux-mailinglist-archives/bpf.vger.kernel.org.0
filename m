As said in the help-wanted email just send out, it was weird that the
RCU grace period was extended a lot, up to ~150ms or more. But queue a
dummy kworker periodically which does nothing will help to reduce the
grace period to ~10ms. I have explained the context of the problem in
that email. And hope that we could get some help from you and the RCU
experts in the community.
