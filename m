But this function, bpf_num_possible_cpus(), is just a utility used while looking up per-CPU maps. I am not sure if it is appropriate to make it an official API. Yonghong, the author of libbpf_util.h, also asked me to put it into libbpf_util. But I am fine with either way. I can move it to libbpf.h/.c if you all agree.

(please avoid top-posting)

It's a good question, I think it depends how much we want to aide users consuming libbpf
that are using per-CPU maps, for example. If we only want to reuse it for in-tree selftests,
it's fine to keep it in an unexposed internal header that selftests would include.
Other option could be to expose and prefix as libbpf_num_possible_cpus() to denote it's a
misc helper and perhaps also move f3515b5d0b71 ("bpf: provide a generic macro for percpu
values for selftests") into libbpf. I'd be fine either way, my preference is to add it
as an libbpf_ API given users would need something along these lines when walking the value
anyway. See e00c7b216f34 ("bpf: fix multiple issues in selftest suite and samples") for
context on why this helper was added and sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) use would be broken
in this context.

Thanks,
Daniel

If including libbpf_internal.h in libbpf_util.h, then the internal stuff will be exposed to whoever include libbpf_util.h. But let me know if there is a better way to print the error messages other than depending on libbpf_internal.
