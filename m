I'm all ears for an alternative solution. Here are the pain points:

  #1) BPF disables preemption unconditionally with no way to do a proper RT
      substitution like most other infrastructure in the kernel provides
      via spinlocks or other locking primitives.

  #2) BPF does allocations in atomic contexts, which is a dubious decision
      even for non RT. That's related to #1

  #3) BPF uses the up_read_non_owner() hackery which was only invented to
      deal with already existing horrors and not meant to be proliferated.

      Yes, I know it's a existing facility ....

TBH, I have no idea how to deal with those things. So the only way forward
for RT right now is to disable the whole thing.

Clark might have some insight from the product side for you how much that
impacts usability.

Thanks,
