I forgot to CC Tejun, so doing it now.

Yes it was an off-list discussion. The discussion was more about the
this_cpu_* ops vs atomic_* ops as on x86 this_cpu_* does not have lock
prefix and how I should prefer this_cpu_* over atomic_* for my series on
objcg charging without disabling irqs. Tejun pointed out this_cpu_* are
not nmi safe for some archs and it would be better to handle nmi context
separately. So, I am not that worried about optimizing for NMI context
but your next comment on generic_atomic64_* ops is giving me headache.

I was actually assuming that atomic_* ops are safe against nmis for all
archs. I looked at atomic_* ops in include/asm-generic/atomic.h and it
is using arch_cmpxchg() for CONFIG_SMP and it seems like for archs with
cmpxchg should be fine against nmi. I am not sure why atomic64_* are not
using arch_cmpxchg() instead. I will dig more.

I also have the followup series on objcg charging without irq almost
ready. I will send it out as rfc soon.

Thanks a lot for awesome and insightful comments.
