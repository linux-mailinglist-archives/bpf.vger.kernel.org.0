The main reason is that map operations from syscall and bpf program use the same
ops in bpf_map_ops (e.g. map_update_elem). If only use dynptr_kern for bpf
program, then
have to define three new operations for bpf program. Even more, after defining
two different map ops for the same operation from syscall and bpf program, the
internalÂ  implementation of qp-trie still need to convert these two different
representations of variable-length key into bpf_qp_trie_key. It introduces
unnecessary conversion, so I think it may be a good idea to pass dynptr_kern to
qp-trie even for bpf syscall.

And now in bpf_attr, for BPF_MAP_*_ELEM command, there is no space to pass an
extra key size. It seems bpf_attr can be extend, but even it is extented, it
also means in libbpf we need to provide a new API group to support operationg on
dynptr key map, because the userspace needs to pass the key size as a new argument.

For qp-trie, it will only support a single dynptr as the map key. In the future
maybe other map will support map key with embedded dynptrs. Maybe Joanne can
share some vision about such use case.
