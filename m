As I understand it, functionally there is no problem.

And if the BPF program has been attached to preemption-disabled code,
there is also no unnecessary damage to real-time latency.  Preemption is
presumably disabled for a reason, and that reason must be respected.
Presumably, people using BPF in real-time systems are careful to either
avoid attaching BPF programs to non-preemptible code on the one hand or
carefully limit the runtime of those BPF programs.

But if the BPF program has been attached to code having preemption
enabled, then the current call to guard(preempt_notrace)() within
__DECLARE_TRACE() means that the entire BPF program is running with
preemption disabled, and for no good reason.

Although this is not a functional issue, it is a first-class bug in
terms of needlessly degrading real-time latency.

And even though it isn't what Sebastian originally asked Mathieu for
help with, it still needs to be fixed.

My current offer is replacing that guard(preempt_notrace)() with its
SRCU-fast counterpart of guard(srcu_fast_notrace)(&tracepoint_srcu).

Light testing is going well thus far, though I clearly need the real-time
guys to both review and test.

I am sure that Mathieu, Sebastian, and the rest won't be shy about
correcting any confusion on my part.  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul
