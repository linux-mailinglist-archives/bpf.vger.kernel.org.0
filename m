Because if whatever LSM modules were implemented using BPF, we won't need
to support LKM-based LSM. Supporting LKM-based LSM is expected because
the LSM community cannot accept whatever LSMs and the Linux distributor
cannot accept whatever LSMs.

Not for experimenting. The advantage of implementing an LSM module using
BPF is that we can load that LSM without making that LSM module in-tree (i.e.
accepted by the LSM community) and built-in (i.e. accepted by the Linux
distributor). That is, the implementer will not try to rewrite a BPF-based
LSM to non BPF-based LSM if the implementer succeed to write that LSM using BPF.

But remaining out-of-tree (i.e. not accepted by the LSM community) might have
disadvantage that the BPF-based LSM is not identified as a LSM because the LSM ID
value won't be assigned. (I don't know where BPF-based LSMs are located in the
kernel source tree. All BPF-based LSMs except trivial examples included in the
kernel source tree will remain out-of-tree ?)
