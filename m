so the idea that bpf prog will see opaque ctx == name and a set
of kfuncs will extract different things from ctx into local dynptrs ?

Have you considered passing dynptr-s directly into bpf progs
as arguments of struct_ops callbacks?
That would be faster or slower performance wise?

of course.

yep. Don't be shy from improving the verifier to your needs.

Overall makes sense, but a bit too abstract for concrete suggestions.
I think it would be best if you just send your rough patches to the list
with comments where things still need work and we will go from there.
