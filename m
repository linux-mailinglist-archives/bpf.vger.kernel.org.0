Only if there are processes in cgroups with unlimited memory limits.

I think you are still missing the point. So, let me be very clear:

Please stop using the "processes in cgroup with memory.max==max can be
source of isolation issues" argument. Having unlimited limit means you
don't want isolation. More importantly you don't really need this
argument for your work. It is clear (to me at least) that we want global
TCP memory accounting to be decoupled from memcg accounting. Using the
flawed argument is just making your series controversial.

I hope I am very clear to stop using the memory.max == max argument.

I am not sure if option 2 will be used by Meta or someone else, so no
objection from me to not pursue it. However I don't want some possibly
userspace policy to opt-in in one or the other accounting mechanism in
the kernel.

What I think is the right approach is to have BPF struct ops based
approach with possible callback 'is this socket under pressure' or maybe
'is this socket isolated' and then you can do whatever you want in those
callbacks. In this way your can follow the same approach of caching the
result in kernel (lower bits of sk->sk_memcg).

I am CCing bpf list to get some suggestions or concerns on this
approach.
