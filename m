This point is strange. I'm working on probe/fixes which is based on
v6.5-rc3, so any bpf-next change should not be involved. Can you recheck
this point?

As far as I understand Steve's method, we will have an intermediate branch
on bpf or probe tree, like 

linus(some common commit) ---- probes/btf-find-api

and merge it to both bpf-next and probes/for-next branch

          +----------------------bpf-next --- (merge bpf patches)
         /                       / merge
common -/\ probes/btf-find-api -/-\
          \                        \ merge
           +----------------------probes/for-next --- (merge probe patches)

Thus, we can merge both for-next branches at next merge window without
any issue. (But, yes, this is not simple, and needs maxium care)

Thank you,
