Hello Dear Friend,

Greetings and sorry for way this email came to you.

I am Mr. Jean Kabore, a branch Manager in Eco Pan African Bank
(E.P.B) Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, West Africa. I Hope that you will
not expose or betray this trust and confidence that I am about to
repose on you for our mutual benefit.

I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $40.5
Million Dollars into your bank account within the next 7 working
days. This money has been dormant for years in our Bank without any
one transacting on it or even laying claim and if you can assist, then
I will be  needing your urgent response  to enable me provide you with
the details of the deal.

Please note that you will have 40% of the above mentioned sum if you
agree to handle this business with me while 60% will be for me  as the
initiator of the deal and I will also relocate to your Country once
the deal is complete to receive and invest my own share.

Regards

Mr Jean Kabore
