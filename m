Hm, I think this is slightly misphrased but I guess I get what you mean.

Basically, userns root can change what {g,u}id bpffs will use to
instantiate inodes once init_user_ns root creates the superblock. IOW,
the {g,u}id mount option isn't guarded and can thus be changed by userns
root.

No, that's correct.
