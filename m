dear,

I got your contact through the internet due to serious searching for a
reliable personality. I am Jenneh Kandeh from FreeTown Capital of
Sierra Leone. Time of opposed to the government of President Ahmad
Tejan Kebbah the ex-leader. l have been on exile in the Porto-Novo
Benin. since 21st November, 2005 But I am current residing in
Porto-Novo Benin due to war of my country, my mother killed on
04/01/2002 for Sierra Leone civilian war my father decided to change
another residence country with me because I am only child for my
family bad news that my father passed away on 25/11/2018.

During the war, My father made a lot of money through the illegal
sales of Diamonds. To the tune of $10,200,000. This money is currently
and secretly kept in ECOWAS security company here in Benin, but
because of the political turmoil which still exists here in Africa, I
can not invest the money by myself, hence am soliciting your help to
help me take these funds into your custody and also advise me on how
to invest it.

And I want to add here that if agreed 35% of the total worth of the
fund will be yours minus your total expenses incurred during the
clearing of the fund in
Porto Novo Benin that 35% is a $3,570,000 (Three Million Five Hundred
And Seventy Thousand United State Dollars) I would like to invest on
heavy duty agricultural equipment and earth moving machines to enable
me go into a full scale mechanized farming. l think that will help me
to ameliorate hunger in the sub-Saharan Africa.

While l wait to hear from you soon, my warm regards to you and your family
