For qp-trie, I had added reuse checking for qp-trie inner node by adding a
version in both child pointer and child node itself and it seemed works, but
using BPF_REUSE_AFTER_RCU_GP for inner node will be much simpler for the
implementation. And it seems for qp-trie leaf node, BPF_REUSE_AFTER_RCU_GP is
needed as well, else the value returned to caller in bpf program or syscall may
be reused just like hash-table during its usage. We can change qp-trie to act as
a set only (e.g., no value), but that will limit its usage scenario. Maybe
requiring the caller to use bpf_rcu_read_lock() is solution as well. What do you
think ?

Now it seems it will wait for RCU GP and i think it is still necessary, because
when the process exits, other processes may still access the local storage
through pidfd or task_struct of the exited process.

It seems bpf_rcu_read_lock() & bpf_rcu_read_unlock() will be used to protect not
only bpf_task_storage_get(), but also the dereferences of the returned local
storage ptr, right ? I think qp-trie may also need this.

I will continue work on this patchset for GFP_ZERO and reuse flag. Do you mean
that you want to work together to implement BPF_REUSE_AFTER_RCU_GP ? How do we
cooperate together to accomplish that ?
