Thanks for the feedback, I think that sounds like a good plan. I will 
work on another patch and I wanted to summarize what I should do.

So basically, I should place the BTF validation on 
bpf_object__init_btf(), that should contain validations for:

- out of range type IDs;
- out of range string offsets;
- FUNC -> FUNC_PROTO references;
- DATASEC -> VAR | FUNC references;
- structs referencing themselves;
