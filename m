Hello Hillf, did you mean to say this issue couldn't happen?
I wish it hadn't happen, as it took me a long time to figure out.
However, it did happen. It could be reproduced with the method I 
offered, You can access the scripts using this link: 
https://lore.kernel.org/cgroups/e90c32d2-2a85-4f28-9154-09c7d320cb60@huawei.com/T/#t.

It's not about how the pool's workers were created, but rather the 
limit(system_wq ) of workqueue. If system_wq reaches its max_active 
limit, the work enqueued afterward will be placed on 
pwq->inactive_works. In this scenario described above, the problem is 
all active works(cgroup_bpf_release) are blocked, and the 
inactive_works(smp_call_on_cpu) couldn't be executed when it forms a loop.

We have discussed this before in V1, you can find in the Link.

Thanks
Ridong
