Very glad that we were able to do this before sending to WG last call. Thank
you, Dave. I left a couple of comments below but here's my AB:

Acked-by: David Vernet <void@manifault.com>

It's probably worth noting that this probably will make it a tiny bit more
difficult for vendors to implement directly from the standard, but I think
that's a small price to pay for having a doc that's properly formatted and
resembles typical IETF standards.

Thanks,
David
