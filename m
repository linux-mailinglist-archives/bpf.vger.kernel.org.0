cannot unpin immediately in the bpf_task_storage_delete() path is understood. 
task_storage can be used in sleepable. It needs to wait for the tasks_trace and 
the regular rcu gp before unpin.

I forgot to mention earlier that bpf_task_storage_delete() will have the 
bpf_selem_free(..., reuse_now == false). It will then do the 
"call_rcu_tasks_trace(&selem->rcu, bpf_selem_free_trace_rcu);". The unpin could 
happen in bpf_selem_free_trace_rcu() in this case. I am suggesting to unpin in 
bpf_selem_free_trace_rcu together with the selem free.

I just noticed the map and its btf_record are gone in 
bpf_selem_free_trace_rcu()... so won't work. :(

I was thinking at least the map value ptr itself needs to be invalidated.

hmm... I haven't thought about the other pointer fields that read before the 
task_release().

Agreed, it is hard to use if only marks uptr invalid. Thinking about it. Even 
marking the map value ptr invalid while other previously read fields keep 
working is also the same weirdness.

Agree that call_rcu() here is the only option. It probably needs to go through 
the tasks_trace gp also.

Can the page->rcu_head be used here?
