Thanks for enumerating these paths; I think they are all feasible. It's
just a matter of weighing trade-offs, naturally.

"Cumbersome" is a nice, succinct way to put it. While we could hack
something together for POC code (if we get to that point before a better
option is available), I don't think this is the right answer for Go
applications in general (based on personal experience, documented
experiences from other projects, and apparently lack of interest in cgo
from the Go team--anyone curious about details need only search the
web).

With a small edge over option #4, I think this is the best of the
options. The downside is that it is not part of the xdp project, so the
developers of the Go implementation will obviously be responsible for
all of the initial and continuing overhead of a full reimplementation.
Toke, you probably see that as an upside :). Regardless, I think that
libxdp is not so large to make this overly burdensome.

Could you please write up that format specification and we will start
running with it?

There is some temptation in asking for this approach because it becomes
part of the xdp project. I just can't help but think it will be a
constant struggle to keep the same level of flexibility and control with
this approach versus access to a full library. I will admit that I am
moderately ignorant about exactly what challenges we might face because
I'm still learning more about bpf, xdp, and libxdp every day; I am
definitely open to being convinced that my concerns are wrong.

This option very tempting. I understand your hesitancy to add another
dependency for running XDP--if it wasn't for that, I may have pushed
harder for this approach. I do like the idea of the xdpd daemon being
part of the xdp project and providing a language agnostic interface to
the library.

There will still need to be a new Go project written to interface with the
daemon. This seems like quite a bit less work than a reimplementation,
but combined with the downside of adding another dependency, I think we
can pass on this option--unless you really have a change of heart :)

Yes, please, if anyone has additional thoughts please weigh in, but I
think my team is ready to commit to option #2.

Any concerns about my assessment and request?

Thanks,
Brian
