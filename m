IIRC Power64 has issues here, 'funnily' their local_t is NMI safe.
Perhaps we could do the same for their this_cpu_*(), but ideally someone
with actual power hardware should do this ;-)

Very few architectures one would care about do not have NMIs. Risc-V
seems to be the exception here ?!?

We have HAVE_NMI_SAFE_CMPXCHG for this -- there are architectures where
this is not the case -- but again, those are typically oddball archs you
don't much care about.

But yes, *64 on 32bit archs is generally not NMI safe.

Not many 32bit architectures have 64bit cmpxchg. We're only now dropping
support for x86 chips without CMPXCHG8b.

Note that in_nmi() is not depending on HAVE_NMI -- nor can it be. Many
architectures treat various traps as NMI-like, even though they might
not have real NMIs.

There is no config symbol for this presently.

True, only because HPPA does not in fact have NMIs.

Older ARM might qualify here.
