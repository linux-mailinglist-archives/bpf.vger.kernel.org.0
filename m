Yay! :)

I'd be curious to see other workloads too. (Your measurements are a bit
synthetic, mostly showing "worst case": one short syscall in a tight
loop. I'm curious how much performance gain can be had -- we should
still do it, it'll be a direct performance improvement, but I'm curious
about "real world" impact too.)

Instead of just "NOP", having the static branches perform a jump would
solve this pretty cleanly, yes? Something like:

	ret = DEFAULT_RET;

	ret = A(args); <--- direct call, no retpoline
	if ret != 0:
		goto out;

	ret = B(args); <--- direct call, no retpoline
	if ret != 0:
		goto out;

	goto out;
	if ret != 0:
		goto out;

out:
	return ret;

Seems like a reasonable thing to do and could be a separate patch.

I assume you mean the integrity subsystem? That just needs to be fixed
correctly. If we switch to this, let's ditch the linked list entirely.
Fixing integrity's stacking can be a separate patch too.

This implies a maintainership chain, with Paul as the sole author. If
you mean all of you worked on the patch, include Co-developed-by: as
needed[1].
