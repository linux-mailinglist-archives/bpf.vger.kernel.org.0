Oh.  I don't see that explicitly laid out in capability.h or in the
commit message for a17b53c4a.  I suspect if I were more familiar
with eBPF it would be obvious based on the detailed list of things
protected.  Perhaps it should've been called CAP_EBPF...

Right, thank you, that seems correct.  Callers with CAP_BPF don't
need to be able to avoid the barrier.

Ondrej, can you send a new patch for that?
