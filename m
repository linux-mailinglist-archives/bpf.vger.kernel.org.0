When its owner (sk/task/cgrp...) is going away, its owner has reached refcnt 0 
and will be kfree immediately next. eg. bpf_sk_storage_free is called just 
before the sk is about to be kfree. No bpf prog should have a hold on this sk. 
The same should go for the task.

The current rcu gp waiting during bpf_{sk,task,cgrp...}_storage_free is because 
the racing with the map destruction bpf_local_storage_map_free().

I think bpf_rcu_read_lock() is primarily for bpf prog.

The bpf_{sk,task,...}_storage_get() internal is easier to handle and probably 
will need to do its own rcu_read_lock() instead of depending on the bpf prog 
doing the bpf_rcu_read_lock() because the bpf prog may decide uaf is fine.

Please submit the GFP_ZERO patch first. Kumar and I can use it immediately.

I have been hacking to make bpf's memalloc safe for the 
bpf_{sk,task,cgrp..}_storage_delete() and this safe-on-reuse piece still need 
works. The whole thing is getting pretty long, so my current plan is to put the 
safe-on-reuse piece aside for now, focus back on the immediate goal and make the 
common case deadlock free first. Meaning the 
bpf_*_storage_get(BPF_*_STORAGE_GET_F_CREATE) and the bpf_*_storage_free() will 
use the bpf_mem_cache_{alloc,free}. The bpf_*_storage_delete() will stay as-is 
to go through the call_rcu_tasks_trace() for now since delete is not the common 
use case.

In parallel, if you can post the BPF_REUSE_AFTER_RCU_GP, we can discuss based on 
your work. That should speed up the progress. If I finished the immediate goal 
for local storage and this piece is still pending, I will ping you first.  Thoughts?
