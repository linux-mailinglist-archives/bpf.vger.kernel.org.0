Privileged Process (PP) sends a Token to Trusted Process (TP).
TP sends the Token along to Untrusted Process, which performs nefarious
deeds.

Privileged Process (PP) sends a Token to Trusted Process (TP).
TP uses Token, and then saves it in its toolbox. PP later sends
TP a different Token. TP realizes that with the combination of
Tokens it now has it can do considerably more than what PP
intended in either of the cases it sent Token for. TP performs
nefarious deeds.

Granted, in both cases TP does not deserve to be trusted. 
Because TP does not run with privilege of its own, it is not
treated with the same level of caution as it would be if it did.

Privileged Process (PP) sends a Token to what it thinks is a Trusted
Process (TP) but is in fact an Imposter Process (IP) that has been
enabled on the system using any number of K33L techniques.

I don't see anything that ensures that PP communicates Tokens only
to TP, nor any criteria for "trust" are met.

Those are the issues I'm most familiar with, although I believe
there are others.
