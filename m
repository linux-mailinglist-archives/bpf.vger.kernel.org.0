Could you add more context around the LLVM lib? The motivation is that libbfd's
interface is not meant to be stable and has changed several times. How does this
look on the LLVM's library side? Also, for the 2nd part, what is Debian's stance
related to the LLVM lib? Would be good if both is explained in the commit message.
Right now it mainly reads 'that libbfd has all these issues, so we're moving to
something else', so would be good to provide more context to the ready why the
'something else' is better than current one.
