Does this mean that every driver have to extend their TX-desc ring with
sizeof(struct xsk_tx_metadata_compl)?
Won't this affect the performance of this V5?

  $ pahole -C xsk_tx_metadata_compl 
./drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac.ko
  struct xsk_tx_metadata_compl {
	__u64 *              tx_timestamp;         /*     0     8 */

	/* size: 8, cachelines: 1, members: 1 */
	/* last cacheline: 8 bytes */
  };

Guess, I must be misunderstanding, as I was expecting to see the @flags
member being preserved across, as I get the race there.

Looking at stmmac driver, it does look like this xsk_tx_metadata_compl
is part of the TX-ring for completion (tx_skbuff_dma) and the
tx_timestamp data is getting stored here.  How is userspace AF_XDP
application getting access to the tx_timestamp data?
I though this was suppose to get stored in metadata data area (umem)?

Also looking at the code, the kernel would not have a "crash" race on
the flags member (if we preserve in struct), because the code checks the
driver HW-TS config-state + TX-descriptor for the availability of a
HW-TS in the descriptor.

I don't think my opaque value proposal is subject to same race problem.
I think this can be stores in metadata area and across tx and tx
completion, because any race on a flags change is the userspace
programmers problem, as it cannot cause any kernel crash (given kernel
have no need to read this).
