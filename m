Sure. The gate keeper can attach at bpf_prog_load time, note there is
already a security hook there we can hook to with the bpf_prog struct
as the only arg. At this point any number of policy about what/who can
load BPF programs can be applied by looking at the struct and context
its being called. For better use of crypto functions we would want this
to be a sleepable program.

Why it needs to be a BPF prog in this model is because I expect the
policy may be very different depending on the env. We have K8s
systems, DPUs, VMs, embedded systems all running BPF and each has
different requirements and different policy metadata.

With BPF/IMA or fsverity infra the caller can be identified by a
hash giving the identity of the loader. This works today.

We can also check a signature of the skel here if needed. Maybe some
kfuncs are still needed (and make it sleepable) I haven't done this
part yet. I found binding identity of the loader to types of programs
is a good starting point. A roster of all BPF programs loaded in a
cluster is doable now. Anyways a kfunc to consume bpf_prog and key
details to return good/bad is probably fine? Or break it down into
the individual ops would be more flexible. This should be enough
to solve the cryptographically verify BPF programs.

There is also an idea that we could provide more metadata about the
program by having the verifier include a summary. One proposed example
was to track helpers/kfuns in use. For example a network program that
can inspect traffic, but not redirect it.

End result is we could build a policy that says these programs can
load these specific BPF programs. And keep those in maps so it can
be updated dynamically on a bunch of running systems. I think you
want the dynamic part so you can have some process to say I'm
adding these new debug programs or new critical security fixes
to the list of allowed BPF programs.

Some other commentary:

Also to be complete a way to load BPF programs in early boot would
reduce/eliminate a window between launched trusted kernel and gate
keeper launch.

Either the gate keeper can ensure it can't be unloaded by also
monitoring those paths or we could just pin a refcnt on it when a
flag is set or it comes from early boot.

Map updates/manipulation can also wreck BPF logic so you will want to
also have the gate keeper track that.

As a first step just making it sleepable and exposing the needed
kfuncs would be realtively easy and get what you need I suspect.
Added the gatekeeper BPF prog at early boot would likely be all
you need?

Thanks,
John
