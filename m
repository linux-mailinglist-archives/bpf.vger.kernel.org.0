Well, this is just a single map :)

We have a use case for one prefix lookups in Cilium. The XDP prefilter uses
either a hash or an LPM (hash is used if only precise match rules specified,
and LPM - if there are CIDR rules):

  https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/master/bpf/bpf_xdp.c#L60-L68

Here the new map works faster than LPM (e.g., for 5000K rules this is about
120ns vs. 80ns for an [IPv6] map lookup on AMD Ryzen 9). With the new map we
also will be able to specify more sophisticated rules for the XDP prefilter,
not only source CIDRs.

The complexity, in fact, is a big concern for us in Cilium - we already have
rather large programs. Adding, at least, a few hundreds lines vs. just doing a
single map lookup is a big deal. (We also have to support older kernels.)

The Tuple Merge implementation uses a [custom] hash table underneath. The
difference with the normal hash table is that we actually have multiple hash
tables inside one - we split rules in several "tables" and do a hash lookup for
each table (and to resolve collisions hash table elements know to which table
they do belong).

I am not sure how to do this automatically. Say, users can define an IPv4
address as __u32, or __u8[4], or __be32. And they can also legally mix the
definitions, as bpf(2) only says "gimme a void *key".

Users don't have problems with specifying, say, LPM keys or socket options in
network byte order, so can we just say: use network byte order for your values?

... which fits the current implementation :)

If we don't let users to specify an algorithm, then do we let them to pass
options for a particular algorithm? For example, if for a particular setup an
option can change a lookup time, say, twice, comparing to the default, then is
this worth to provide such a toggle? If we let users to provide options, then
once we change the default algorithm, those options won't, most probably, have
meaning for the new one.

We actually can do both things here. For a "default" algorithm we won't let
users to specify any non-generic, algorithm-specific, options. But if a user
specifies a particular algorithm, then setting algorithm-specific options will
be allowed.
