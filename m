that seems doable, kprobe-multi api already supports both symbols and addresses,
and because ftrace keeps track of each ftrace-able function we can tell which
is which via ftrace_location call

looks like there's also register_kprobes call that registers kprobes for multiple
addresses

I wonder what's the standard kprobe attach slowdow nowaday, it was substantial few
years back, will check to have an idea
