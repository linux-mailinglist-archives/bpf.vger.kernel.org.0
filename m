I see. Neither the performance reason nor the memory limitation fit here.

There is no need to add new sys_bpf commands. We can extend bpf_attr to
support variable-sized key in qp-trie for bpf syscall. The probem is the
keys from bpf syscall and bpf program are different: bpf syscall uses
ptr+size tuple and bpf program uses dynptr, but the APIs in bpf_map_ops
only uses a pointer to represent the key, so qp-trie can not distinguish
between the keys from bpf syscall and bpf program. In qp-trie v1, the
key of qp-trie was similar with LPM-trie: both the syscall and program
used the same key format. But the key format for bpf program changed to
dynptr in qp-trie v2 according to the suggestion from Andrii. I think it
is also a bad ideal to go back to v1 again.

It is a feasible solution, but it will make qp-trie be different with
other map types. I will try to extend the APIs in bpf_map_ops first to
see how much churns it may introduce.
