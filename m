I should have been more clear because Andrew was very responsive.
However, Neel Gala appears to be the "maintainer" in the sense that
Andrew defers what gets merged into the repo to him. Neel has not
provided any feedback, and he needs to comment before Andrew will merge
anything in.

Yes, that is a possibility. To my knowledge GCC and the spec generator
have moved away from using this repo. Is it still used by QEMU?

All of the LaTeX bit orders were hardcoded in strings. As such, the bit
order is described for the LaTeX format but not in general. It would not
make sense to hardcode them a second time for the output of the Linux
generation. You can see the strings by searching for 'latex_mapping' in
the constants.py file.

It seems to me that it will be significantly more challenging to use
riscv-opcodes than it would for people to just hand create the macros
that they need.
