The patchset implements the bpf_oom_kill_process() helper, which kills
the desired process the same way as the kernel oom killer: with the help
of the oom reaper, dumping corresponding stats into dmesg and bumping
corresponding memcg- and system-level stats.

For additional reporting generic bpf<->userspace interaction mechanims
can be used, e.g. ringbuffer.

Thanks!
