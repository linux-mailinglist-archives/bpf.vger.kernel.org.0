I am sure there are plenty of good precedents about how to handling a
patchset that affecting multi subsystems.
Let's be more specific about what are the options here:
1. Keeping all changing as one patchset targetting the net-next tree
   as this version does.
2. Breaking all changing into two patchsets, the one affecting current APIs
   targetting the mm tree and the one supporting new APIs targetting
   net-next tree.
3. Breaking all changing into two patchset as option 2 does, but both patchsets
   targetting net-next tree to aovid waiting for the changing in mm tree
   to merged back to net-next tree for adding supporting of new APIs.

I am not sure your perference is option 2 or option 3 here, or there are others
options here, it would be better to be more specific about your option here. As
option 2 doesn't seems to make much sense if all the existing users/callers of
page_frag seems to be belonged to networking for testing reasons, and the original
code seemed to go through net-next tree too:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b63ae8ca096dfdbfeef6a209c30a93a966518853

And the main reason I chose option 1 over option 2 is: it is hard to tell how
much changing needed to support the new usecase, so it is better to keep them
in one patchset to have a bigger picture here. Yes, it may make the patchset
harder to review, but that is the tradeoff we need to make here. As my
understanding, option 1 seem to be the common practice to handle the changing
affecting multi subsystems. Especially you had similar doubt about the changing
affecting current APIs as below, it seems hard to explain it without a new case:

I am not sure if breaking it into more patchset is the common practice
to 'get more eyes' here.
Anyways, it is fair enough ask if there is more concrete reasoning
behind the asking and it is common practice to do that, and I would
love to break it to more patchsets to perhaps make the discussion
easier.

The above is one of the reason I am not willing to do the spliting.
It is hard for someone to tell if the refactoring affecting current APIs
will be enough for the new usecase without supporting the new usecase,
isn't it possible that some refactoring may be proved to be unnecessary
or wrong?

It would be better to be more specific about what do you mean by
'they are providing page as a return value in several cases where they
don't need to' as above.

It would be better to be more specific about above too so that we don't
have to have more refactoring patchsets for the current APIs.

I am not sure if the commit log in patch 6 needs some rephasing to
answer your question above:
"As the get_order() implemented by xtensa supporting 'nsau'
instruction seems be the same as the generic implementation
in include/asm-generic/getorder.h when size is not a constant
value as the generic implementation calling the fls*() is also
utilizing the 'nsau' instruction for xtensa.

So remove the get_order() implemented by xtensa, as using the
generic implementation may enable the compiler to do the
computing when size is a constant value instead of runtime
computing and enable the using of get_order() in BUILD_BUG_ON()
macro in next patch."

See the below in the next patch, as the PAGE_FRAG_CACHE_MAX_ORDER
is using the get_order():
BUILD_BUG_ON(PAGE_FRAG_CACHE_MAX_ORDER > PAGE_FRAG_CACHE_ORDER_MASK);

Sure, it is just that there is only 24h a day for me to do things
more generically. So perhaps I should remove patch 9 for now so
that we can improve thing more generically.
