Yes, absolute output path works for libelf, zlib, and bpf:

Auto-detecting system features:
...                        libelf: [ [32mon[m  ]
...                          zlib: [ [32mon[m  ]
...                           bpf: [ [32mon[m  ]


Are {feature,FEATURE-DUMP} created in multiple places?
I don't see them in $(OUTDIR)/tools -- there is no /bpf/ subdir there
at all.
I do see them in $(OUTDIR)/kernel/bpf/preload/ -- are those different
feature files?


thanks.
