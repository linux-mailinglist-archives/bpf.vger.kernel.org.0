I can't find any code that would reference
/sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbfs/unbind or /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbfs wrt
virtio. Where's the host side code for that?

Honestly, I don't understand how this is supposed to work. The USB
device is bound to the usb_generic driver, usbfs doesn't have a link to
the devices it's supposed to handle.
