I have already explained in details why the 1) reply value from the bpf prog 
won't work. Please go back to that reply which has the context.

I sort of guess this while stalled in the traffic... :/

I was not asking to be able to "selective on all skb of a large msg". This will 
be a separate topic. If we really wanted to support this case (tbh, I am not 
convinced) in the future, there is more reason the default behavior should be 
"off" now for consistency reason.

The comment was on the existing tcp_tx_timestamp(). First focus on allowing 
selective tracking of the skb that the current tcp_tx_timestamp() also tracks 
because it is the most understood use case. This will allow the bpf prog to 
select which tcp_sendmsg call it should track/sample. Perhaps the bpf prog will 
limit tracking X numbers of packets and then will stop there. Perhaps the bpf 
prog will only allocate X numbers of sample spaces in the bpf_sk_storage to 
track packet. There are many reasons that bpf prog may want to sample and stop 
tracking at some point even in the current tcp_tx_timestamp().
