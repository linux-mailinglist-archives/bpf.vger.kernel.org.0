Good point.

If we want not to skip other layers, maybe we can use tc ?

1) allocate ireq and set sack_ok etc with kfunc
2) bpf_sk_assign() to set ireq to skb (this could be done in kfunc above)
3) let inet_steal_sock() return req->sk_listener if not sk_fullsock(sk)
4) if skb->sk is reqsk in cookie_v[46]_check(), skip validation and
   req allocation and create full sk
