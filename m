Thanks for this extra explanations.  It is a little bit difficult for
me to understand how the min/max teaks for exactly, but you did give
me the general idea.

>=20

Unfortunately, io.cost does not seem to control I/O with this
configuration, as it gives the interfered the same bw as no I/O
control (i.e., none as I/O scheduler and no I/O controller or policy
active):

                          none        io.weight            BFQ
target's throughput       0.8            0.7                 4
total throughput          506            506               344

The test case is still the rand reader against 7 seq readers.

Now io.weight does control I/O, but throughputs fluctuate a lot
between runs and during each run.  After extending the duration of
each run to 20 seconds, an average run for io.weight and BFQ gives the
following throughputs (same throughputs as above for none):

                          none        io.weight            BFQ
target's throughput       0.8            2.3               3.6
total throughput          506            321               360

For completeness I tried also with rlat=3D1000.  But throughputs dropped
dramatically:

                          none        io.weight            BFQ
target's throughput       0.8            0.2               3.6
total throughput          506            17               360

Are these results in line with your expectations?  If they are, then
I'd like to extend benchmarks to more mixes of workloads.  Or should I
try some other QoS configuration first?

Thanks,
Paolo
