As I understand it, BPF programs cannot loop and are limited to 4096 instructions.
Has anyone done any timing to see just how much having preemption off while a
BPF program executes is going to affect us? Are we talking 1us or 50us? or longer?
I wonder if there's some instrumentation we could use to determine the maximum time
spent running a BPF program. Maybe some perf mojo...

I guess my question here is, are the allocations done on behalf of an about-to-run
BPF program, or as a result of executing BPF code?  Is it something we might be able
to satisfy from a pre-allocated pool rather than kmalloc()? Ok, I need to go dive
into BPF a bit deeper.

I'm sure I'll regret asking this, but why is up_read_non_owner() a horror? I mean,
I get the fundamental wrongness of having someone that's not the owner of a semaphore
performing an 'up' on it, but is there an RT-specific reason that it's bad? Is it
totally a blocker for using BPF with RT or is it something we should fix over time?

Clark is only just starting his journey with BPF, so not an expert.

I do think that we (RT) are going to have to co-exist with BPF, if only due to the
increased use of XDP. I also think that other sub-systems will start to
employ BPF for production purposes (as opposed to debug/analysis which is
how we generally look at tracing, packet sniffing, etc.). I think we *have* to
figure out how to co-exist. 

Guess my "hey, that look interesting, think I'll leisurely read up on it" just got
a little less leisurely. I'm out most of the day tomorrow but I'll catch up on email
over the weekend.
