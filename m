Perhaps explicitly mention here that the reason it doesn't
 propagate to checkpoint #0 (despite the arrow) is that there's
 a write mark on c1[r6].

Also worth mentioning somewhere that write marks are really a
 property of the arrow, not the state â€” a write mark in c#1 tells
 us that the straight-line code from c#0 to c#1 contains a write
 (thus 'breaking' that arrow for read mark propagation); it lives
 in c#1's data structures because it's c#1 that needs to 'know'
 about it, whereas c#0 (and its parents) need to 'know' about any
 *reads* in the straight-line code from c#0 to c#1 (but these are
 of no interest to c#1).
I sometimes summarise this with the phrase "read up, write down",
 though idk how useful that is to anyone outside of my head ;)

This isn't correct; we look at `state->live` here, because if in
 the straight-line code since the last checkpoint (parent)
 there's a write to this register, then reads should not
 propagate to `parent`.
Then there's the complication of the `writes` variable in
 mark_reg_read(); that's explained by the comment on
 propagate_liveness(), which AFAICT you don't cover in your
 doc section about that.  (And note that `writes` is only ever
 false for the first iteration through the mark_reg_read() loop).

May be worth stating that the principle of the algorithm is that
 read marks propagate back along the chain until they hit a write
 mark, which 'screens off' earlier states from the read.
Your doc implies this but afaict never states it explicitly, and
 I think it makes the algo easier to understand for someone who
 doesn't already know what it's all about.

Apart from that, this is great.  I particularly like your diagram
 of the parentage chains.
