Also found the problem when developing the "fix the release of inner
map" patch-set. I have written a selftest which could reliably reproduce
the problem by using map-in-map + bpf_list_head. The reason of using
map-in-map is to delay the release of inner map by using call_rcu() as
well, so the free of bpf_map happens after the release of btf. Will post
it later.

The patch delays the release of BTF id of bpf map, so test_btf_id
failed. Can we fix the problem by optionally pinning the btf in
btf_field_graph_root just like btf_field_kptr, so the map BTF will still
be alive before the invocation of btf_record_free() ? We need to do the
pinning optionally, because btf_record may be contained in btf directly
(namely btf->struct_meta_tab) and is freed through btf_free().
