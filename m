Note that every field already identifies the bit order (or, for the
case of compressed instructions, register restrictions) since that=E2=80=99=
s
needed to produce the old LaTeX instruction set listings; that=E2=80=99s =
why
there=E2=80=99s jimm20 vs imm20, for example. One could surely encode =
that in
Python and generate the LaTeX strings from the Python, making the
details of the encodings available elsewhere. Or just have your own
mapping from name to whatever you need. But, either way, the
information should all be there today in the input files, it=E2=80=99s =
just a
matter of extending the script to produce whatever you want from them.
