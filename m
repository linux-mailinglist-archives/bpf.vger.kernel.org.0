IMHO it *MUST* be lifted, as disabling IRQs here is hurting other parts
of the system and actual production systems.

The "offending" IRQ-spin_lock commit (0fa294fb1985) is from 2018, and
GitHub noticed in 2019 (via blog[1]) and at Red Hat I backported[2]
patches (which I now understand) only mitigate the issues.  Our prod
systems are on 6.1 and 6.6 where we still clearly see the issue
occurring.  Also Daniel's "rtla timerlat" tool for catching systems
latency issues have "cgroup_rstat_flush_locked" as the poster child [3][4].

Like Tejun, I share the concern that keeping this a spinlock will
can increase the chance of several CPUs contend on this lock (which is
also a production issue we see).  This is why I suggested to "exit" if
(1) we see the lock have been taken by somebody else, or if (2) stats
were flushed recently.

For (2), memcg have a mem_cgroup_flush_stats_ratelimited() system
combined with memcg_vmstats_needs_flush(), which limits the pressure on
the global lock (cgroup_rstat_lock).
*BUT* other users of cgroup_rstat_flush() like when reading io.stat
(blk-cgroup.c) and cpu.stat, don't have such a system to limit pressure
on global lock. Further more, userspace can easily trigger this via
reading those stat files.  And normal userspace stats tools (like
cadvisor, nomad, systemd) spawn threads reading io.stat, cpu.stat and
memory.stat, likely without realizing that kernel side they share same
global lock...

I'm working on a code solution/proposal for "ratelimiting" global lock
access when reading io.stat and cpu.stat.

Yes, networking hard IRQ will raise softirq, but software often also
raise softirq.
I see where you are going with this... the cgroup_rstat_flush_locked()
loop "play nice" check happens with IRQ lock held, so you speculate that
IRQ handler will not be able to raise softirq, thus
local_softirq_pending() will not work inside IRQ lock.

We will see if you hate my current code approach ;-)
