If you end up introducing this new kwrapper program type in libbpf, I
think that it'll make sense to have something similar in bpftrace, too.
Allowing users to write separate kprobe and kretprobe programs and
transparently combining them into kwrapper doesn't seem to bring much
value to me.

Jirka, if you need help with implementing bpftrace support for this, let
me know. I'm very interested in having this capability there.
