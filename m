I see it now (what I missed). At TX time you are storing a pointer where
to (later) write the TS at completion time.  It just seems overkill to
store 8 byte (pointer) to signal (via NULL) if the HWTS was requested.
Space in the drivers TX-ring is performance critical, and I think driver
developers would prefer to find a bit to indicate HWTS requested.

If HWTS was *NOT* requested, then the metadata area will not be updated
(right, correct?). Then memory area is basically garbage that survived.
How does the AF_XDP application know this packet contains a HWTS or not?

 From an UAPI PoV wouldn't it be easier to use (and extend) via keeping
the @flags member (in struct xsk_tx_metadata), but (as you already do)
not let kernel checks depend on it (to avoid the races).

Sure, I can just create some room after struct xsk_tx_metadata, via 
setting something larger than sizeof(struct xsk_tx_metadata).  I'm 
buying that.
