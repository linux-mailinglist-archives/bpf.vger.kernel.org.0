Dear friend,

My name is Mrs. Nicole Apollonia, from Toulouse France. I have been
suffering from ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says that I have
just a short time to live. For the past Twelve years, I have being
dealing on gold exportation, before falling ill due to the Cancer.

Now that I am very sick and according to the doctor,i will not survive
the sickness.The worst of it all is that I do not have any family
members or children to inherit my wealth.I am writing this letter now
through the help of the computer beside my sick bed.I have $4.5
Million US Dollars deposited in Eco-Bank here in Burkina Faso and I am
willing to instruct my bank to transfer the fund to you as my foreign
Trustee.You will apply to the bank, that they should release the fund
to you, but you will assure me that you will take 50% of the fund and
give 50% to the orphanages home in your country for my soul to rest
after i have gone.In my next email, I will send you the copy of the
Certificate of Deposit which will enable you apply to the bank and
receive the money with no case.Respond to me immediately for further
details and instructions since I am in the end times of my life due to
the ovarian cancer disease.
Hoping to receive your response as soon as possible.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs. Nicole Apollonia,
