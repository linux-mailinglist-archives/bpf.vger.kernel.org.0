Good to get confirmed this is "more-or-less" your suggestion/direction.

I'm thinking, that is it very unlikely that XDP have modified the
fragments.  So, why are we allocating and copying the fragments?
Wouldn't it be possible for this veth code to bump the refcnt on these
fragments? (maybe I missed some detail).

I like this "thought" of yours :-)

Yes, precisely.
I distinctly remember what I tried to poke you and Eric on this approach
earlier, but I cannot find a link to that email.

I would really appreciate, if you Alex, could give the approach in
veth_convert_skb_to_xdp_buff() some review, as I believe that is a huge
potential for improvements that will lead to large performance
improvements. (I'm sure Maryam will be eager to help re-test performance
for her use-cases).
