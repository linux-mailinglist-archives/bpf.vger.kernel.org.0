Consider this code:

    int foo(void)
    {
    	if (static_branch_likely(&key))
    		return 33;
    	return 55;
    }

    int hoo(void)
    {
    	if (static_branch_unlikely(&key))
    		return 33;
    	return 55;
    }

When the key is disabled the corresponding code is:

    0000000000000010 <foo>:

When the key is enabled, the code is:

    0000000000000010 <foo>:

So, for the likely case we set branch to JUMP/NOP when key is OFF/ON.
And for the unlikely case we set branch to NOP/JUMP when key is
OFF/ON. The kernel keeps this information, and when
static_key_enable(key) is executed, it does [simplified for reading]

	for (entry = key->start; entry < stop; entry++)
	        arch_jump_label_transform(entry, jump_label_type(entry));

this jump_label_type() contains this bit of information: are we
writing NOP or JUMP for an enabled key. Same for
static_key_disable(key).

Now, for BPF we do static_branch_enable(branch). To generate proper
JITed code, we have enough of information (NOP=0, JUMP=2):

    static_branch_enable(JA[SRC=1|NOP]) jits to ARCH_JUMP
    static_branch_enable(JA[SRC=1|JUMP]) jits to ARCH_NOP
    static_branch_disable(JA[SRC=1|NOP]) jits to ARCH_NOP
    static_branch_disable(JA[SRC=1|JUMP]) jits to ARCH_JUMP

But how do we represent this in xlated code to user? Do we patch the
xlated code? If we do, then

    static_branch_enable changes JA[SRC=1|NOP] to JA[SRC=1|JUMP], ARCH_JUMP generated
    static_branch_disable sees JA[SRC=1|JUMP], changes it to JA[SRC=1|NOP], but ARCH_JUMP is generated

or what about two static_branch_enable on the same branch? By flipping
I meant that we always do

    JA[SRC=1|NOP]  jits to ARCH_NOP
    JA[SRC=1|JUMP] jits to ARCH_JUMP

the primitive operation is static_branch_flip which changes
JA[SRC=1|NOP] to JA[SRC=1|JUMP] and vice versa. Then for
static_key_enable(key) we flip all the branches if key was disabled
and do nothing otherwise. Same for static_key_enable.

What you've proposed before is to keep this "third bit" in
xlated+jitted form.  Basically, we check the state of the branch
"on/off" like this: say, we see that xlated/jitted state of a branch
is JA[SRC=1|NOP] and ARCH_JUMP, then we can say that this branch is
on. How do we report it to user in PROG_INFO to we set the instruction
to JA[SRC=1|JUMP] in output, specifying that its current stae is to
jump? This would work, I think.

This doesn't work without the kernel side, as we change instructions
offsets inside the verifier when, e.g., converting helper calls to
individual instructions, etc.

Otherwise, this is more-or-less what my patch does: get a list of
offsets of banches inside the program, associate them with a map (or
ID of any kind), and then push to kernel.

And if you need to keep this list in kernel, then it looks like we can
keep it and access per key, not in a loop...

Alternative is to encode key ID in the instruction in some form so
that it is visible in xlated code after the program is loaded. But in
this case this makes users responsible to writing iterators and
bookkeeping all relationships vs. just loading a program with a map
fd, which is a well-established api in BPF.

Is this possible to use map like it is used in my patch, but do
sys_bpf(cmd=STATIC_KEY_ENABLE, attr.map_fd) so that it specifically
separated from map_update_value? (If it was not a map, but
just some "bpf object"?)
