Just to be sure. IMHO, the above should be enough to decide when
a ftrace-like trampoline could be freed. But it is not enough
to decide whether any task is still in the middle of the BPF
program that the trampoline jumped to.

You will likely need something more complicated to decide when it is safe
to free the BPF program itself. The stack check probably won't help.
I guess that the stack will be marked as unsafe in BPF program because
there will be no data for ORC unwinder. But some simple reference
counting might do the job.
