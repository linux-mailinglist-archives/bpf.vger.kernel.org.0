In cls_bpf we use the tailroom grow for slow-path icmp [0], which may be the
primary use-case from my PoV for the tailroom grow. We haven't had a case where
we need it for crafting custom DNS replies though (it looks like you have one in
XDP (?), so may be good to add a sample code w/ your XDP series on this).

The issue from your fail1 example should very likely be that the offset in your
case is unbounded so verifier cannot do anything with this information. You would
need to make the offset bounded, add it to data and then open the range in the
data/data_end test with the constant you're accessing later, see my comment. I
haven't run your example, but that is what I'd probably try first.

Thanks,
Daniel
