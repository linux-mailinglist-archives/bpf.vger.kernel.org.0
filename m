I'm using LKM-based LSM with any version between 2.6.0 and 6.6-rc2, without patching
__ro_after_init out. We can load LKM-based LSMs, without patching the original kernel.
And it seems to me that several proprietary security products for Linux are using
this trick, for LSMs for such products cannot be built into distributor's kernels...

LKM-based LSMs are not officially supported since 2.6.24. But people need LKM-based LSMs.
It is very sad that the LSM community is trying to lock out out of tree LSMs
( https://lkml.kernel.org/r/ec37cd2f-24ee-3273-c253-58d480569117@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp ).
The LSM interface is a common property for *all* Linux users.

I'm not objecting the performance benefits by replacing with static calls.
I'm not happy that the LSM community ignores the Torvald's comment at https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/1/192
and does not listen to minority's voices.
