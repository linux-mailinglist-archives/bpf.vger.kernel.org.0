You described it nicely! And on top of that there was recent work that
will be available in 1.28 to reduce the memory footprint of pahole,
using it to find things to pack in itself, reducing the number of
allocations, not keeping unreferenced CUs around (you did it), part of
the work to have it working on 32-bit architectures, where we had
reports of it not working.

There is certainly more optimizations to be made to reduce its memory
footprint while allowing it to run in parallel, but at this point it
seems to have addressed the problems that were reported.

More people trying it and measuring the impacts, to confirm the tests
and analysis we did and you alluded too can be only a good thing in
getting us all informed and confortable with using this option by
default.

BTW, we have now a tests/ directory with a regression test for this
feature and another for the --prettify feature in pahole (use DWARF or
BTF to pretty print raw data with several tricks on finding the right
data structure based on enumerations when the conventions used in a
project allow for that, that is the case with tools/perf, also for using
header sizes to traverse variable sized records, etc), please see:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/pahole/pahole.git/tree/tests

And:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/pahole/pahole.git/commit/?id=fd14dc67cb6aaead553074afb4a1ddad10209892
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/pahole/pahole.git/commit/?id=be638365781ed0c843249c5bcebe90a01e74b2fe

This should help us in detecting problems earlier, brownie point to
whoever gets this hooked up in CI systems, existing or new 8-)

Thanks,
