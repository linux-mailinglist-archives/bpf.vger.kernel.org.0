Thanks for the patches and working on this feature.

One thing that still needs to check is the "bpftool struct_ops dump" support for 
kmod's btf. The bpftool changes can be a followup. However, please check if the 
current uapi has what it needs. A quick look is the userspace should be able to 
find the kmod btf from the map_info->btf_vmlinux_value_type_id.

We discussed a bit offline on patch 8 about putting the btf and module refcnt 
together in bpf_struct_ops_map_free (but before synchronize_rcu_mult) which 
should further simplify patch 8 also. hope that will work out.

Looking forward to v12.
