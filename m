I'm Richard Wahl, and I claimed the winning ticket for the sum of $533 million Mega Millions lottery jackpot.  Out of my $533,000,000.00 million Powerball jackpot, I decided to give away $1,000,000 U.S.D each to 40 lucky person's of which your email was randomly picked. 

I recently moved to New Jersey from Michigan and has only played the lottery a few times before winning the $533 million Mega Millions lottery jackpot.  Link/proof : https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=tne02ExNDrw
