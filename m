It is an x86-64 host, so my previous guess is wrong.

Please install bpftrace on the host firstly, then running the following
one-line script in the host when bpf_map_update_elem() starts to return
-ENOMEM:

# sudo bpftrace -e 'kr:htab_lru_map_delete_node { if (retval == 0) {
@lock[cpu] = count(); } else { @del[retval & 0xff, cpu] = count(); } }
i:s:10 { exit(); }'

The script above tries to account the return value of
htab_lru_map_delete_node():
(1) if htab_lock_bucket() returns true,  retval will 0, so account the
case in the @lock map
(2) if the target node is found in the hash list, the lowest byte of
retval will be 1, otherwise it will 0. These returns are accounted in
@del map.

The snippet 'i:s:10 { exit(); }' is used to terminate the script after
10 seconds. You could adjust the time to a smaller one if there are too
many accounting. The following is the output from my local developer
environment:

# bpftrace -e 'kr:htab_lru_map_delete_node { if (retval == 0) {
@lock[cpu] = count(); } else { @del[retval & 0xff, cpu] = count(); } }
i:s:10 { exit(); }'
