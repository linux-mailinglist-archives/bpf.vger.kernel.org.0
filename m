This is true. Some investigation is needed.

If we move this out uapi/bpf.h to an unstable header, we will have much
more flexibility for future change. Original idea (v1) to allocate the
whole struct on the stack would be okay even if kernel changes
struct vma_iterator size, whether bigger or smaller.
