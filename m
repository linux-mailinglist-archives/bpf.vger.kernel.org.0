Few tangential trains of thought here, separated by multiple newlines
for easier reading.


IIUC the any-context BPF allocator will not actually allocate memory in NMI
context, instead relying on its existing pre-filled caches.

Alexei's patch adding the allocator says ([0]):

  The allocators are NMI-safe from bpf programs only. They are not NMI-safe in general.

So sounds bpf_mem_alloc in a kfunc called by a BPF program is NMI-safe.


That's not to say that I'm happy about adding a fallible bpf_mem_alloc call here
before the kfunc can do anything useful. But it seems like the best way to
guarantee that we never see a mailing list message like:

  Hello, I just added a field to 'struct ma_state' in my subsystem and it seems
  I've triggered a BUILD_BUG_ON in this far-away BPF subsystem. It looks like
  you're making stability guarantees based on the size of my internal struct.
  What the hell?

Sure, after I remove the kfuncs and struct bpf_iter_task_vma fwd decl from
bpf_helpers.h - per your other comment below - we can do the whole "kfuncs
aren't uapi and this struct bpf_iter_task_vma is coming from vmlinux.h,
not some stable header" spiel and convince this hypothetical person. Not having
to do the spiel here reinforces the more general "Modern BPF exposes
functionality w/ kfuncs and kptrs, which are inherently _unstable_" messaging
more effectively than having to explain.


If we go back to putting struct vma_iterator on the BPF stack, I think we
definitely want to keep the BUILD_BUG_ON. If it were removed and vma_iterator
size changes, that would affect portability of BPF programs that assume the old
size of bpf_iter_task_vma, no? Which bpf_for_each is doing since it puts
bpf_iter_task_vma on the stack.

Is there some CO-RE technique that would handle above scenario portably? I
can't think of anything straightforward. Maybe if BPF prog BTF only had
a fwd decl for bpf_iter_task_vma, and size thus had to be taken from
vmlinux BTF. But that would fail to compile since it the struct goes
on the stack. Maybe use some placeholder size for compilation and use
BTF tag to tell libbpf to patch insns w/ vmlinux's size for this struct?


Re: padding bytes, seems worse to me than not using them. Have to make
assumptions about far-away struct, specifically vma_iterator
which landed quite recently as part of maple tree series. The assumptions
don't prevent my hypothetical mailing list confusion from happening, increases
the confusion if it does happen ("I added a small field recently, why didn't
this break then? If it's explicitly and intentionally unstable, why add
padding bytes?")

As alluded to in my long response above, this sounds reasonable, will
remove from here.
