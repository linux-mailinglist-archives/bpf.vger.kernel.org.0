No, that was very helpful, thanks! Just the kind of detail I was after
to understand your deployment scenario :)

Yeah, so what I was thinking was whether it would be useful to, for
instance, define a "bundle" format that contains the config data that
libxdp will understand. Could just be a JSON schema containing keys for
priority, chain call actions and a filename, so you can just point
xdp_program__open_file() at that and it will do the rest.

However, I'm still not quite sure I'm convinced that this will be
generally useful. As you say, you can just as well just set the values
programmatically after loading the file, and I suspect that different
deployments will end up having too much custom stuff around this that
they'll bother using such a facility anyway. WDYT?

Well that's basically what 'struct xdp_program' in libxdp is :) You can
create an array of those (setting their properties with the setter
methods as you mentioned above) and pass them to
xdp_program__attach_multi() which will build a dispatcher for all of
them and attach that (incorporating any programs that may already be
attached by their priority).

Yeah, that's totally what would make sense for your deployment case. The
design where libxdp reads a config file comes from my distro
perspective: We want to build a system whereby different applications
can each incorporate XDP functionality and co-exist; and the goal is to
make libxdp the synchronisation point between them. I.e., we can say to
application authors "just use libxdp when writing your application and
it'll work", while at the same time empowering sysadmins to change the
default application ordering.

By having that configuration be part of the library, applications can be
free to use either the command-line loader or include the loading into
their own user-space binary.

But since you are (notionally) both the application developer and system
owner, that is less of a concern for you as you control the whole stack.

Sure, that you can certainly achieve with implementing what libxdp
includes today. I'm just trying to make sure we explore any
opportunities for standardising something useful so others can benefit
from it as well; so I hope you'll forgive my probing :)

Right, OK. How does the admin configuring the orchestration system
figure out which order to run programs in, BTW? Is this obvious from the
nature of the programs, or do you document it out of band somewhere, or
something like that?
