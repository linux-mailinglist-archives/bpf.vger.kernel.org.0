A tight loop in the kernel can extend RCU grace periods, especially
for kernels built with CONFIG_PREEPTION=n.  Placing things like
cond_resched() in such loops can help.  Of course, if you are in an
RCU read-side critical section (or holding a spinlock), you will need
to exit, cond_resched(), then re-enter.  Taking care to ensure that the
state upon re-entry is valid.  After all, having exited either type of
critical section, anything might happen.
