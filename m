Sorry, what's the problem then?

Michal asked how we can prevent an indefinite pinning of a dying memcg by an associated
bpf map being used by other processes, and I guess the objcg-based reparenting is
the best answer here. You said it will complicate the deployment? What does it mean?

From a user's POV there is no visible difference. What am I missing here?
Yes, if we reparent the bpf map, memory.max of the original memory cgroup will
not apply, but as I said, if you want it to be effective, don't delete the cgroup.

Thanks!
