I like that we are considering a mutex lock, because it is not
reasonable to be waiting by spinning on the lock from remote CPUs,
because this cgroup_rstat_lock is held for too long (up to 64-128 ms in 
[prod]).

I like the combination of the two mem_cgroup_flush_stats_ratelimited()
and memcg_vmstats_needs_flush().
IMHO the jiffies rate limit 2*FLUSH_TIME is too high, looks like 4 sec?

I like the time-based limit because it doesn't require tracking pending
updates.

I'm looking at using a time-based limit, on how often userspace can take
the lock, but in the area of 50ms to 100 ms.

This sound interesting, to unconditionally drop the lock at each CPU
boundary.  We should experiment with this.

With a mutex lock contention will be less obvious, as converting this to
a mutex avoids multiple CPUs spinning while waiting for the lock, but
it doesn't remove the lock contention.

Userspace can easily triggered pressure on the global cgroup_rstat_lock
via simply reading io.stat and cpu.stat files (under /sys/fs/cgroup/).
I think we need a system to mitigate lock contention from userspace
(waiting on code compiling with a proposal).  We see normal userspace
stats tools like cadvisor, nomad (and systemd) trigger this by reading
all the stat file on the system and even spawning parallel threads
without realizing that kernel side they share same global lock.

You have done a huge effort to mitigate lock contention from memcg,
thank you for that.  It would be sad if userspace reading these stat
files can block memcg.  On production I see shrink_node having a
congestion point happening on this global lock.
