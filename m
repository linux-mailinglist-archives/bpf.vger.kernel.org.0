Yes, will do. The first thought comes into my mind is implementing .get_info hook

in a bpf tcp_congestion_ops and checking its return value in userspace by

getsockopt(fd, TCP_CC_INFO).Â  I also consider to add a new BPF struct_ops

for testing purpose, but it may be a little overkill.

I just check that it can be applied both on bpf and bpf-next, do you

have other commits in your tree ?
