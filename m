imo, I also think a printk here will be a noise in dmesg most of the time (but 
much better than an unexpected -EFAULT).

Is it possible to only -EFAULT when the bpf prog setting a ctx.optlen larger 
than the "original" user provided optlen?
Ignore for all other cases that is due to the current PAGE_SIZE limitation?
