I am not planning to. The check if a mitigation is enabled or not is a
different topic, that also might require some further refactor.

This patch set focuses in the initialization of the mitigation code
at build time. Initializating the mitigation code might not result in
the mitigation being enabled in runtime.

For instance, you can build the kernel to mitigate the GDS, but the
runtime detects that you are running in a guest VM, and depend on the
host to do the mitigation, so, the mitigation might be enabled or not,
even if it is initialized with CONFIG_GDS_FORCE_MITIGATION=y.

Detecting if the mitigation is enabled or not is an orthogonal problem
than the one I am trying to solve with this patch set.
