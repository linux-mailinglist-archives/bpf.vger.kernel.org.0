Subject: FOSDEM 2025 eBPF Devroom Call for Participation
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

We are delighted to announce the Call for Participation (CFP) for the
very first eBPF Devroom at FOSDEM!

Mark the Dates
--------------

- December 1st, 2024: Submission deadline
- December 15th, 2024: Announcement of accepted talks and schedule
- February 1st, 2025 (Saturday afternoon): eBPF Devroom at FOSDEM

eBPF at FOSDEM
--------------

FOSDEM is a free, community-organized event focusing on open source, and
aiming at gathering open source software developers and communities to
meet, learn, and share. It takes place annually in Brussels, Belgium.
After hosting a number of eBPF-related talks in various devrooms over
the years, FOSDEM 2025 welcomes a devroom dedicated to eBPF for the
first time! This devroom aims at gathering talks about various aspects
of eBPF, ideally on multiple platforms.

Topics of Interest
------------------

If you have something to present about eBPF, we would love for you to
consider submitting a proposal to the Devroom.

The projects or technologies discussed in the talks MUST be open-source.

Topics of interest for the Devroom include (but are not limited to):

- eBPF development: recent or proposed features (on Linux, on other
  platforms, or even cross-platform), such as:
    - eBPF program signing and supply chain security
    - Profiling eBPF with eBPF
    - eBPF-based process schedulers
    - eBPF in storage devices
    - eBPF verifier improvements or alternative implementations
    - Memory management for eBPF
- Deep-dives on existing eBPF features
- Working with eBPF: best practices, common mistakes, debugging, etc.
- eBPF toolchain, for compiling, managing, debugging, packaging, and
  deploying eBPF programs and related objects
- eBPF libraries, in C/C++, Go, Rust, or other languages
- eBPF in the real world, production use cases and their impact
- eBPF community efforts (documentation, standardization, cross-platform
  initiatives)

The list is not exhaustive, don't hesitate to submit your proposal!

Format
------

FOSDEM 2025 will be an in-person event in Brussels, Belgium.
We do not accept remote presentations.

We're looking for presentations in one of the following sizes:

- 10 minutes (for example, a short demo)
- 20 minutes (for example, a project update)
- 30 minutes (for example, an introduction to a new technology or a deep
  dive on a complex feature)

The durations above include time for questions: allow at least 5 to 10
minutes, depending on the total length, to answer questions from the
public.

How to Submit
-------------

Please submit your proposals on Pretalx, FOSDEM's submissions tool, at
https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2025/cfp

Make sure to select "eBPF" as the track.

The official communication channel for the Devroom is the dedicated
FOSDEM mailing list, ebpf-devroom@lists.fosdem.org. If you submit a
talk, please make sure to join the list:
