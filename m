Great. In our case, it would be ideal if the application developer
doesn't even need to be aware of the XDP_RUN_CONFIG and can just omit
it. I guess for our implementation that would mean that we don't error
out if the BTF section doesn't exist, and instead we look to our
configuration data (more on that below) for the relevant information.

As part of our control plane we have a whole process for a sysadmin to
get config data to to our BPF orchestration tool, which is running on
multiple nodes. It very abstractly looks like this:


                                     +---- Node 1
                                     |
UI -> API -> DATABASE -> CONFIG DATA +---- Node 2
                                     |
		                     +---- Node N

So, the sysadmin using the UI or API would dictate which xdp programs
run *and* what their priority is (plus anything else that would
otherwise go into XDP_RUN_CONFIG, plus a bunch of other config data for
various other needs). Then--and hopefully I'm getting this right--when
our (Go) orchestration tool uses (Go) libxdp, the tool needs a way to
set the run order for the XDP programs before the dispatcher loads. I
was planning to set the run order programatically on the XDP program
objects via libxdp calls. It looks like your libxdp implementation
already has ways to do this in the form of xdp_program__set_run_prio()
and xdp_program__chain_call_enabled().

Does that make sense? This is still all very theoretical for me at this
point!

OK, that makes sense. Since I want to keep our implementation purely in
Go (if possible), what I trying to say what that I hope there's an
existing Go library that can parse and read BTF (Cillium's Go eBPF
library looks promising). After thinking more about our orchestration
config data use case I was describing above, though, I don't think
reading XDP_RUN_CONFIG from BTF is strictly necessary for our use case.
That said, it obviously would be preferable to conform to the
specification, plus it does look necessary to read the program IDs from
BTF anyway :)

Will do. Thanks for your help!
