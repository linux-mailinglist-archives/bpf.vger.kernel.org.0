`Where 'imm' is first sign extended to 64 bits and then converted to an unsigned
64-bit value` is true for the 64 bit operation, for the 32-bit it's just converted
to an unsigned 32-bit value, see the (u32)IMM which is (u32)(s32) insn->imm. From
the phrasing, it was a bit less clear perhaps.

Thanks,
