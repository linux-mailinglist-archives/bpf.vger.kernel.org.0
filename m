Masami,
we recently discussed the possibility to store data between entry/return probe,
IIUC your current patchset [0] allows that, but it seems to be shared across all
the tracers for the given function (__ftrace_return_to_handler).. is the plan to
make the shadow stack per tracer and function? /cc Steven
