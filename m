I've posted my HID WIP on [1]. It probably won't compile as my local
original branch was having a merge of HID and bpf trees.

yeah, this is a concern.

right now I need 4 hooks in HID, the first 2 are already upstream:
- whenever I need to retrieve the report descriptor (this happens in a
  sleepable context, but non sleepable is fine)
- whenever I receive an event from a device (non sleepable context, this
  is coming from a hard IRQ context)
- whenever someone tries to write to the device through
  hid_hw_raw_request (original context is sleepable, and for being able
  to communicate with the device we need sleepable context in bpf)
- same but from hid_hw_output_report

Again, the first 2 are working just fine.

Implementing the latter twos requires sleepable context because we
might:

1. a request is made from user-space
2. we jump into hid-bpf
3. the bpf program "converts" the request from report ID 1 to 2 (because
we export a slightly different API)
4. the bpf program directly emits hid_bpf_raw_request (sleepable
operation)
5. the bpf program returns the correct value
6. hid-core doesn't attempt to communicate with the device as bpf
already did.

In the series, I also realized that I need sleepable and non sleepable
contexts for this kind of situation, because I want tracing and
firewalling available (non sleepable context), while still allowing to
communicate with the device. But when you communicate with the device
from bpf, the sleepable bpf program is not invoked or this allows
infinite loops.

In the end I have 4. However, I might have programs that overwrite twice
the same callback (see the 2 SEC("fmod_ret/hid_bpf_device_event") in
[2]).

yes

performance is not a requirement. It's better if we have low latency but
we are not talking the same requirements than network.

I'll need to have a deeper look at it, yeah.

Actually I'd like to remove bpf_tail_call entirely, because it requires
to pre-load a BPF program at boot, and in some situations (RHEL) this
creates issues. I haven't been able to debug what was happening, I
couldn't reproduce it myself, but removing that bit would be nice :)

Benjamin
