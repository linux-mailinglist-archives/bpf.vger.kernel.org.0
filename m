that's correct, uretprobe syscall is installed by kernel to special user
memory map and it can be executed only from there and if process calls it
from another place it receives sigill

so at the end the process executes the uretprobe syscall, but it's up to
kernel to decide that and set it up..  but I don't know if that's strong
enough reason for seccomp to ignore the syscall

I could think of sysctl for that.. you complained earlier about weird
semantics for that [1], but I think it's better than to remove it
