afaict, __sock_recv_timestamp does not put the timestamp cmsg but ip_recv_error 
still returns the skb to the user.

I suspect we are talking the same thing. When SOF_TIMESTAMPING_SOFTWARE is not 
set in sk and SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_* is set in cmsg, the existing (aka 
traditional) way is that the generated skb will still be queued in the error 
queue. The user space can still read it but just won't have the timestamp cmsg.

If I understand how the v3 may look like, the skb will not be queued in the 
error queue at all because the sk has no SOF_TIMESTAMPING_SOFTWARE. The user 
space won't get it from the error queue which is a change of behavior. I was 
saying I am fine but not sure if someone depends on this behavior.

I think we start talking pass each other on this. I will wait for the code on 
this part and the selftest first.

Got it. This part is now understood.

It is one of the reasons for my earlier question on which SOF_* that bpf needs 
to support. I want to simplify the naming part of the SOF_* in bpf_sesockopt but 
lets leave these nits for a little later.

However, it will be very useful to highlight which SOF_* will never be used in 
bpf in v3.

bpf_tcp_iter prog can. That said, the idle connection example is too carry away 
as an excuse that bpf_setsockopt does not need to support turning-off. Sure, 
idle connection is as good as off. and yes, detach is as good as off also.

I am now acting as a broken clock repeating myself that not all use cases run 
for 5 mins and then detach, so I need to be specific here that bpf_setsockopt 
not supporting off is a nack. There are many use cases in production that the 
bpf prog runs forever and wants to turn it on-and-off.

Again, bpf sockops prog is not the only one can bpf_setsockopt(). bpf-tcp-cc 
that runs forever can also bpf_setsockopt to ask the sockops bpf prog to do 
periodic timestamping when needed. bpf_tcp_iter can also bpf_setsockopt to turn 
it off if needed.

I am not asking to clear the sk_tsflags_bpf when the bpf prog is detached. I am 
asking to support clearing the sk_tsflags_bpf in bpf_setsockopt().

I have still yet heard a technical reason why bpf_setsockopt cannot clear the bits.

In patch 5, I meant the BPF_SOCK_OPS_TX_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_CB_FLAG is redundant. 
It is as good as testing and setting sk_tsflags_bpf alone.

This could be some cleanup for the later stage of the set.

Have you looked at the selftests/bpf directory?

prog_tests/setget_sockopt.c may be something closer to what you need.

There is a recent one in the mailing list also:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241016-syncookie-v1-0-3b7a0de12153@bootlin.com/

The expectation is to be able to run the test like this: ./test_progs -t 
setget_sockopt

Yes, please add the sendmsg timestamp capturing in the selftest. It is useful.

Later is fine but before this set lands. I am not asking a full UDP 
implementation but need ideas on how that may look like. We need some clarity on 
how UDP will work and also how much new sockops API extension will be needed to 
decide if sockops is the correct one going forward. I don't want to end up tcp 
is in sockops and UDP (and others) is non sockops.

That said, the current priority is to get bpf prog and user space work without 
stepping on each other first.
