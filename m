The tri-state may not work. For example,

main_prog:
    call sub1
    call sub2
    call sub1
    call sub3

async:
    call sub4 ==> UNKNOWN -> MAYBE
    call sub3
    call sub4 ==> MAYBE -> NO_PRIV_STACK?

For sub4 in async which is called twice, for the second sub4 call,
it is not clear whether UNKNOWN->MAYBE transition happens in
main_prog or async. So based on transition prototol,
second sub4 call will transition to NO_PRIV_STACK which is not
what we want.

So I think we still need a separate bit in bpf_subprog_info to
accumulate information for main_prog tree or any async tree.

Okay, indeed we can treat struct_ops the same as other tracing programs.
They are adaptive too subject to various conditions where priv state may
not be used, e.g. small stack size, tailcall, and potentially nested subprogs.
