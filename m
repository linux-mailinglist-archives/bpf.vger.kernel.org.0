Yes, even though the messages are sometimes confusing I find that there
are also occasions where they're actually useful to users not familiar
with the error names (not easy to figure out what "ESRCH" means if
you've never seen it before), so I'd avoid removing them entirely from
bpftool. Just as Andrii writes, we talked [0] on displaying both the
error name and the description through libbpf_strerror_r():

	Error: can't get next program: [-EPERM] Operation not permitted

So that users with more knowledge can skip the description and just look
at the error name.

I haven't started to work on this, though.
