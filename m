We should have lruvec or memcg available. lruvec_memcg() could be used
to get memcg from the lruvec. It might be more places to add the id but
arguably this would improve them to identify where the memory has been
scanned/reclaimed from.

I do not follow. Could you be more specific please?

Right. This could be all hidden in the tracing code. You simply do not
print memcg id when the controller is disabled. Or just simply print 0.
I do not really see any major problems with that.

I would really prefer to focus on that direction rather than adding
another begin/end tracepoint which overalaps with existing begin/end
traces and provides much more limited information because I would bet we
will have somebody complaining that mere nr_reclaimed is not sufficient.
