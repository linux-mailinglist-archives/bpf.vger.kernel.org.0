OK, I will bite...  Why do you think this is weird?

RCU depends on context switches, among other things.  If you have a
long-running in-kernel task, that will naturally extend the grace period.
Scheduling the empty worker provided the context switch that RCU needed
to make forward progress.

So 150 milliseconds is an OK RCU grace period.  A bit long, but not
excessively so.  In contrast, by default in mainline, RCU starts seriously
complaining if its grace period is extended beyond 21 *seconds*.  This is
when the RCU CPU stall warning will appear.  (Yes, some Android configs
are tuning this down to 20 milliseconds, but that is a special hardware
and software configuration.)

But if you want shorter RCU grace periods, what can you do?

1.	Follow Alexei's good advice on one of your early patches.

2.	As an alternative to scheduling an empty kworker, invoke something
	like rcu_momentary_dyntick_idle() periodically.  Note well that
	it is illegal to invoke this in an RCU read-side critical section,
	with preemption disabled, from idle, ...

3.	In non-preemptible kernels, cond_resched() is a much lighter
	weight alternative to rcu_momentary_dyntick_idle().  (Preemptible
	kernels get the same effect by preempting.  In your case, this
	is also true, but it takes 150 milliseconds.)

That should do for a start.  ;-)
