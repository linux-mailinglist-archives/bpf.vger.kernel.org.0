I think what I outlined is even unnecessarily complicated. You don't
need that pointless "delegate" mount option at all actually. Permission
to delegate shouldn't be checked when the mount option is set. The
permissions should be checked when the superblock is created. That's the
right point in time. So sm like:

In fact this is conceptually generalizable but I'd need to think about
that.
