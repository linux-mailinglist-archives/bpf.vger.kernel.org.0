Hi Paul,

thanks for your response!

I am using ArchLinux and also have all these defines.

But when if I am not hardcoding the syscall numbers but use the
__NR_access kernel define then I should always get the correct number for the
ABI I am compiling for (or an error if the syscall does not exist), no?

I do see constants for all the possible ABIs but not one constant that always
represents the one I am currently compiling for.
The same way the syscall number defines always give me the syscall number for
the currently targeted ABI.
