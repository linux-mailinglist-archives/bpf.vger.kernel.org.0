yeah, it works.  the brittleness comes when i don't mark a function 
always_inline, but i don't notice since the compiler was inlining it 
anyways.  but eventually i make a change and the compiler decides to 
not-inline it.  e.g. i call the same function again somewhere else in my 
program, and now it's worth it to make it a separate function.

it's not super urgent - and i've been hit by it enough times that i can 
usually find the problem if it pops up.

stuff like this:

https://github.com/google/ghost-userspace/blob/main/third_party/bpf/biff_flux.bpf.c#L115

similar to that one, i have an "AVL tree insert" function that the 
compiler didn't want to inline - especially if i called it twice.  (the 
AVL code hasn't hit our opensource ghost repo yet).

i was talking about bpf subprogs.  though one helper that would be nice 
to call while holding a lock is bpf_loop.  i've got some loops that i'd 
turn into bpf-loops, but can't due to the spinlock.

thanks,
