The link can be detached (struct_ops's unreg) by the user space.

The link can also be detached from the subsystem (cgroup) here.
It was requested by scx:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240530065946.979330-7-thinker.li@gmail.com/

Not sure if scx has started using it.

Does it have plan for a pure kernel module oom implementation?
I think the link-to-cgrp support here does not necessary stop the
later write to cgroupfs support if a kernel module oom is indeed needed
in the future.

imo, cgroup-bpf has a eco-system around it, so it is sort of special. bpf user
has expectation on how a bpf prog is attached to a cgroup. The introspection,
auto detachment from the cgroup when the link is gone...etc.

If link-to-cgrp is used, I prefer (2). Stay with one way to attach
to a cgrp. It is also consistent with the current way of attaching a single
bpf prog to a cgroup. It is now attaching a map/set of bpf prog to a cgroup.
The individual struct_ops implementation can decide if it should
allow a struct_ops be attached multiple times.
