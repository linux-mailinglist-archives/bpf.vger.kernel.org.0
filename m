Is CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_NMI_SAFE_THIS_CPU_OPS the right config to
differentiate between such archs? I see Power64 does not have that
enabled.

As Vlastimil pointed out (last point), I don't think I will need 64bit
cmpxchg, 32bit cmpxchg will be fine.

Hmm what about CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_NMI_SAFE_THIS_CPU_OPS?

Thanks a lot Vlastimil & Peter for the suggestions. Let me summarize
what I plan to do and please point out if I am doing something wrong:


#if defined(CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_NMI_SAFE_THIS_CPU_OPS) || !defined(CONFIG_HAVE_NMI)

// Do normal this_cpu* ops

#elif defined(ARCH_HAVE_NMI_SAFE_CMPXCHG)

// Do 32 bit atomic ops with in_nmi() checks

#else

// Build error or ignore nmi stats??

#endif


WDYT?

(BTW Vlastimil, I might rebase send out the irq-safe series before this
nmi one.)

thanks,
Shakeel
