no worries. I'll be off myself the next few days too :)

Yes, exactly that. See [0] for my current WIP. I've just sent it, not
for reviews, but so you see what I meant here.

That part is indeed painful.

No, I was meaning the special context argument for bpf_prog_run. But
anyway, this is relatively moot if struct_ops that you mention below is
working :)

Last time I checked, I thought struct_ops were only for defining one set
of operations. And you could overwrite them exactly once.
But after reading more carefully how it was used in tcp_cong.c, it seems
we can have multiple programs which define the same struct_ops, and then
it's the kernel which will choose which one needs to be run.

AFAICT there is no sleepable context concerns as well, it depends on how
the kernel starts the various ops.

Last, I'm not entirely sure how I can specify which struct_ops needs to be
attached to which device, but it's worth a shot. I've already realized
that I would probably have to drop the current way of HID-BPF is running,
so now it's just technical bits to assemble :)
