Yes, I agree. But what if 256 active works can't finish because they are 
waiting for a lock? the works at inactive list can never be executed.

cgroup_destroy_wq is not stopped by cgroup_mutex, it has acquired 
cgroup_mutex, but it was blocked cpu_hotplug_lock.read. 
cpu_hotplug_lock.write is held by cpu offline process(step3).

I have to admit, it is a complicated issue.

System_wq was not overloaded with __lockup_detector_reconfigure, but 
with cgroup_bpf_release_fn. A large number of cgroups were deleted. 
There were 256 active works in system_wq that were 
cgroup_bpf_release_fn, and they were all blocked by cgroup_mutex.

To make it simple, just imagine what if the max_active max_active of 
system_wq is 1? Could it result in a deadlock? If it could be deadlock, 
just imagine all works in system_wq are same.

I also agree, why I move cgroup_bpf_release_fn away, cgroup has it own 
queue. As TJ said "system wqs are for misc things which shouldn't create 
a large number of concurrent work items. If something is going to 
generate 256+ concurrent work items, it should use its own workqueue."

There is a deadlock, and i think it have to be fixed.

I will modify the diagram.
And I hope you can understand how it leads to deadlock.
Thank you Michal for your reply.

Thanks,
