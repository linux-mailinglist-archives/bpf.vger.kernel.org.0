Dearest Friend,

I am Mrs. Jenny Bezos from America  USA, I decided to donate what I
have to you  for investment towards the good work of charity
organizations, and also  to help the motherless and the less
privileged ones and to carry out charitable works in your Country and
around the World on my Behalf.

I am diagnosing of throat Cancer, hospitalize for good 2 years and
some months now and quite obvious that I have few days to live, and I
am a Widow no child; I decided to will/donate the sum of $7.8 million
to you for the good work of God, and also to help the motherless and
less privilege and also forth assistance of the widows. At the moment
I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact that my
relatives (who have squandered the funds for this purpose before) are
around me and my health also. I have adjusted my will and my Bank  is
aware.

 I have willed those properties to you by quoting my Personal File
Routing and Account Information. And I have also notified the bank
that I am willing to give that property to you for good, effective and
prudent work. It is right to say that I have been directed to do this
by God. I will be going in for a surgery soon and I want to make sure
that I make this donation before undergoing this surgery.  I will need
your support to make this dream come through, could you let me know
your interest to enable me to give you further information. And I
hereby advise you to contact me by this email address.

Thanks
Mrs. Jenny Bezos.
