Written From Hospital.

    I know that this message may be a very big surprise to you,
Please do not feel disturbed for contacting  you in this regards, It
was based on the critical health condition I find mine self.  My names
are Mrs. Francisca John  Carlsen from Denmark wife of late Mr John
Carlsen, a widow and I=E2=80=99m suffering from brain tumor disease and thi=
s
illness has gotten to a very bad stage, I married my husband for Ten
years without any family members and no child.

My husband died after a brief illness that lasted for few  days. Since
the death of my husband, I decided not to remarry again, When my late
husband was alive he deposited the sum of ($11.000.000 Eleven million
dollars.) with the Bank. Presently this money is still in bank. And My
 Doctor told me that I don't have much time to live because my illness
has gotten to a very bad stage, Having known my condition,I decided to
donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am
going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person
who can claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages,
widows and also build schools for less privileges that will be named
after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and
the effort that the house of God is maintained.

However all I need and required from you is your sincerity and ability
to carry out the transaction successfully and fulfill my final wish in
implementing the charitable project as it requires absolute trust and
devotion without any failure and I will be glad to see that the bank
finally release and transfer the fund into your bank account in your
country even before I die here in the hospital, because my present
health condition is very critical at the moment everything needs to be
proccess rapidly as soon as possible.

It will be my pleasure to compensate you as my Investment
Manager/Partner with 35 % percent of the total fund for your effort in
handling the transaction, 5 % percent for any expenses or processing
charges fee that will involve during this process while 60% of the
fund will be Invested into the charity project there in your country
for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileges ones.

Meanwhile I am waiting for your prompt respond, if only you are
interested for further details of the transaction and execution of
this  humanitarian project for the glory and honor of God the merciful
compassionate.

May God bless you and your family.

Best Regards,
Mrs. Francisca John  Carlsen
