That's also what libxdp does; if no XDP_RUN_CONFIG is found, it just
uses the defaults (run prio 50 + chain call on XDP_PASS).

Yeah, and what I was interested in was how the orchestration tool gets
this data (and the BPF programs themselves)? Is there a daemon running
on the nodes that exposes an API? Are you pushing this via SSH/Ansible?
Infinite monkeys with typewriters inputting data? Something else? :)

Yup, totally possible to set this programmatically with libxdp as well
today. However, before doing so you still need to communicate the list
of BPF programs and their run configuration to each node. And I'm
thinking it may be worthwhile to specify how to do this as part of the
"protocol" and also teach libxdp about the format, so others won't have
to reinvent the same thing later.

The reason I went with the embedded BTF is that this gets compiled into
the ELF file, and so we can be pretty sure that it doesn't get lost,
without having to keep track of separate configuration files. So this
makes it a good fit for BPF program authors specifying a default: they
can be pretty sure that this will stay with the object code no matter
how it's moved around.

The downside of using BTF is of course the same: it's tightly coupled to
the compiled binary, and it's a bit awkward to parse (and modify). So I
always anticipated that a secondary format that was *decoupled* from the
binary byte code format would be needed, just as you're describing. So
I'm just looking for input on what such a format might reasonably look
like :)

See above re: my reasons for picking the BTF format. Not sure how you're
developing the BPF programs, but it may turn out to be useful to have
program authors specify defaults as well. E.g., you could have whatever
process *inserts* programs into your database (assuming that's where you
store the available programs) read default values from the BTF and
pre-populate the admin UI with those when someone wants to load
programs?

The program IDs are allocated by the kernel on load, so those have
nothing to do with BTF. But you'll likely want to support BTF-defined
maps, and the freplace functionality itself relies on BTF being present;
so you'll need to handle it somehow... :)
