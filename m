XDP Hints have been discussed on Netdev 0x15, and we kinda
established the optimal way for doing it. This RFC's approach
is not actual anymore.
You could just write to me and request write perms on our open
GitHub repo (which was mentioned here several times) for Hints
to do things if not together, then in one place at least.
I'll be off for two weeks since next Monday, Michal could get
you into things if you decide to join after than point
(if at all).

Thanks,
Al
