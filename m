IMHO, it may be hard to insert nop (actually it is mcount call) to the
inlined function, because the inlined function code is optimized with
the caller code. In this case, it is hard to find where is the original
entry code. For example, a specific entry code can be skipped even if
a part of its body is used. Thus we need to put mcount calls for each
(but there can be a code which calls both entry and the body).

But if we can work with compilers, since it knows how it optimizes the
code, it may be possible.

It is possible if we can find the actual entry points. Of course using
kprobes means it will take a time (overhead) to insert the sw
breakpoints and to sync the code.
