Altogether, when possible.  AF_ALG has been (and continues to be)
incredibly problematic, for both security and maintainability.

Not for small amounts of data, since syscalls are expensive these days.

(Aren't BPF programs usually fairly small?)

BTW, both gcc and clang reliably lower rol32() to a single instruction.

Well, userspace programs that want accelerated crypto routines without
incorporating them themselves should just use a userspace library that
has them.  It's not hard.

But iproute2 should be fine with just the generic C code.

As for why AF_ALG support keeps showing up in different programs, it's
mainly just a misunderstanding.  But I think you're also overestimating
how often it's used.  Your 5 examples were 4 bindings (not users), and 1
user where it's disabled by default.

There are Linux systems where it's only iproute2 that's blocking
CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_HASH from being disabled.  This patch is really
valuable on such systems.
