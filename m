Hi, thanks for the patch - and thanks Andrii for the Cc. I didn't have
time to look at the code yet (will do), but the idea looks great.

My main question would be, how much overhead does the sorting add to the
BTF dump, and if this overhead is low, is it even worth having a
dedicated command-line keyword to trigger the sorting, or should we just
make it the default behaviour for the C-formatted dump? (Or is there any
advantage in dumping with the current, unsorted order?)

Quentin
