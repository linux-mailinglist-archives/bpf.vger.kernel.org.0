The only thing I know that works that way is usbip, and it requires
unbinding each of the interfaces:

https://sourceforge.net/p/usbip/git-windows/ci/master/tree/trunk/userspace/src/bind-driver.c#l157

That means that, for example, revoking access to the raw USB device
that OpenRGB used to blink colours across a keyboard would disconnect
the keyboard from the HID device.

Can you show me any other users of that "trick" that would keep the
"hid" keyboard driver working while access to the /dev/bus/usb/* device
node is revoked/closed/yanked/unbound?

And if you can't, I would appreciate some efforts being made trying to
understand the use case, along with the limitations we're working
against, so we can find a good solution to the problem, instead of
retreading discussion points.
