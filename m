Yes.  Actually, at netconf I mentioned the cookie generation hook will not
be necessary and should be replaced with XDP.

Maybe we even need not extend it and can use XDP as said below.

I didn't come up with kfunc to create ireq and queue it to listener, so
cookie_v[46]_check() were best place for me to extend easily, but now it
sounds like kfunc would be the way to go.

Maybe we can move the core part of cookie_v[46]_check() except for kernel
cookie's validation to __cookie_v[46]_check() and expose a wrapper of it
as kfunc ?

Then, we can look up sk and pass the listener, skb, and flags (for sack_ok,
etc) to the kfunc.  (It could still introduce some conflicts with Eric's
patch though...)
