It is arguable that the missing "offset = 0;" here is a programmerâ€™s error 
rather than the limitation of the offset approach itself. Adding it could be a 
quick fix for this corner case.

That said, it is a very rare case, given there is a "while (... && bucket == 
st->bucket)" condition, and the bug has probably existed since 2010 in commit 
a8b690f98baf. If there is a plan for a long-term fix in /proc/net/tcp[6], I 
think it is reasonable to wait also. I do not have a strong opinion either way. 
I am just unsure if any users care about the skip improvement in /proc/net/tcp[6].
