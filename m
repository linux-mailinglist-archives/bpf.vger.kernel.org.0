I was thinking about this today so I'm glad you brought it up.

IIUC putting unique data in the metadata area will prevent GRO from
working. I wonder if as a part of this work there's a cleaner way to
indicate to XDP or GRO engine that some metadata should be ignored for
coalescing purposes. Otherwise the final XDP prog before GRO would need
to memset() all the relevant bytes to 0 (assuming that even works).

Thanks,
Daniel
