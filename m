This is an artifact of the existing stacking behavior (and solving it,
if needed, can be done in parallel to this series). Specifically it
seems Tomoyo is in the "lsm=" list when it shouldn't be.

That said, I've long advocated[1] for a way to explicitly disable LSMs
without affecting operational ordering. I think it would be very nice to
be able to boot with something like:

lsm=!yama

to disable Yama. Or for your case, "lsm=!tomoyo". Right now, you have to
figure out what the lsm list is, and then create a new one with the
LSM you want disabled removed from the list. i.e. with v6.2 and later
check the boot log, and you'll see:

LSM: initializing lsm=lockdown,capability,landlock,yama,integrity,apparmor

If you wanted to boot with Yama removed, you'd then pass:

	lsm=lockdown,capability,landlock,integrity,apparmor

As a boot param. But I think this is fragile since now any new LSMs will
be by-default disabled once a sysadmin overrides the "lsm" list. Note
that booting with "lsm.debug=1" will show even more details. See commit
86ef3c735ec8 ("LSM: Better reporting of actual LSMs at boot").

So, if a distro has no support for an LSM but they want it _available_
in the kernel, they should leave it built in, but remove it from the
"lsm=" list. That's a reasonable bug to file against a distro...
