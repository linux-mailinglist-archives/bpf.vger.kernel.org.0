I think the basic idea can work (it's similar to systemd's socket
activation, which also passes the socket fd to the userspace process on
launch). However, there are a couple of things that become impossible
for the userspace process to do in this model:

- Modifying the BPF object before load: Libbpf does quite a few
  transformations on the bytecode to handle relocations, and it's also
  going to grow a full linker at some point. This is not a problem if
  the userspace program just lets libbpf do the default thing, but if it
  wants to customise the operations it becomes a problem. The obvious
  use case for this that comes to mind is dynamically omitting parts of
  the code for features that are not enabled (like we do in xdp-filter).

- Populating maps before load: This is necessary to use customised
  'const' global variables: The map backing these are frozen on load to
  allow the verifier to make strong assumptions about their content, so
  you can't modify them after the map is loaded.

- Atomic map population: Say you have an XDP program that reacts to
  traffic steering rules, and you start out with the program being
  attached to the interface and an empty map that userspace then has to
  populate. While the map is being populated, the XDP program will
  process some packets with an incomplete view of the final ruleset.
  Whereas if you can populate the map completely before attaching the
  program you can be sure that it's consistent. Depending on the nature
  of the application, this may lead to weird effects, or it may be
  mostly harmless.

Now, all of these could in principle be performed by the orchestrator on
behalf of the program, but that means you'll have to make the
orchestrator more complex, and you'll have to come up with a way to
express these operations in your configuration language.

Both approaches carry complexities with it, and I'm not sure there
really is a universal right answer. What tipped the scales for me were
the issues above. However, being in a more controlled environment, the
trade off may well be different for you.

Yeah, I do agree that it would be nicer if there was a clean interface
the application could talk to without having to muck about with
dispatchers. My hope is that by encapsulating all that in a library we
can pretend that there is :)

However, I can see how this perspective may also be different in a Go
world: With a C library in a distro we can ship the library as a
separate package and as long as we maintain ABI compatibility, we can
upgrade the library independently of the applications. Whereas with Go's
vendoring approach it becomes way harder to ensure that all applications
use the "right" version of the library. In that sense, a C library is
more of a "system service" whereas a Go library is more of an
"application sub-function".

Only slightly :)
As outlined above all of this has gone into my thinking when designing
libxdp, so I appreciate the chance to get your perspectives on these
very real tradeoffs. So thanks again for taking the time to explain your
thought process!
