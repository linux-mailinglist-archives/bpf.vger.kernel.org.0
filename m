If the legacy cycles event in a metric is a problem, can we change the
metric to be more specific?

I think ARM/Apple-Mx is fine without this change, right?

I'm not sure it's a problem.  I think it works as expected...?

Well, I think having PMU name in the event is a big difference.  Legacy
events were there since Day 1, I guess it's natural to think that an
event without PMU name means a legacy event and others should come with
PMU names explicitly.
