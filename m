fair enough. I'm ok to skip verbose().

Correct. I'm with you so far...

and here I'm a bit lost.
Precision marking will do r1->precise=true while walking P1 in that state.

The change:
mark_all_scalars_precise(env, env->cur_state);
will mark both r0 and r1 in P1, but that's unnecessary.

I'm not seeing the issue yet.
