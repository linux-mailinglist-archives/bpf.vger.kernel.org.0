From Mr.Dorso Sandwidi
Bank of Africa (B.O.A)
Burkina Faso Ouagadougou


My Dear Friend, please I want you to read this letter very carefully
and I must apologize for barging this message into your mail box
without any formal introduction due to the urgency and confidential of
this issue and I know that this message will come to you as a
surprise. Please this is not a joke and I did not want you to joke
with it.

I am Mr.Dorso Sandwidi, Manager in Bank Of Africa (B.O.A) Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso. I Hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust
and confident that I am about to establish with you for the mutual
benefit of you and I. This fund was deposited in our bank by Mr.
Kattan Azmal from Jordan who died in a plane crash in 2000 Tbm 700
aircraft on 31st July with his wife and the whole crew on board.

I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of ($15) million
USD into your account within 14 working banking days. This money has
been deposited for years in our Bank without claim due to the owner of
this fund died along with his entire family in an air crash since July
31st 2000.

The reason why i contacted you is that after the bank audit in 24th of
November, we found out that this fund has remained unclaimed since the
death of the deceased costumer. I want our bank to release this fund
to you as the nearest person to our deceased customer while I come
over to your country to share this fund with you as soon as you
confirm this fund into your account and ask me to come over. I don't
want the money to go into our Bank treasure as an abandoned fund. So
this is the reason why i contacted you so that our bank will release
this money to you as the next of kin to the deceased customer. Please
I would like you to keep this proposal as a top secret and delete it
if you are not interesting.

Upon the receipt of your reply and indication of your capability, I
will give you full details on how the business will be executed and
also note that you will have 50% of the above mentioned sum if you
agree to handle this business with me while 50% be for me, Because I
don't want anyone here in our bank to know my involvement until you
confirm this fund into your account and ask me to come over for the
sharing as I indicated.


I am looking forward to hear from you immediately for further information
