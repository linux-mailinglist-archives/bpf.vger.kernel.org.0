So IIUC, for a trusted pointer, any member or nested member
access (without pointer tracing) is trusted.
For example
    struct p2 {
       struct t1 *s1;
       struct t2 s2;
    };
    struct p {
       struct p1 f1;
       struct p2 f2;
       struct p3 f3;
    }
    struct p *trust_p;

So here &trust_p->f1, &trust_p->f2, &trust_p->f3, &trust_p->f2.s2
are all trusted, right?
