I still think it's better to have PMU with events (and people do that)
but I feel like I have to drop my argument.  It's there for a while and
I don't want to break things..

I think it's an Apple-M PMU's problem leaving it broken.  And it should
be ok as long as it can use the sysfs encoding with arm_blah/cycles/.

So that's, I believe, the expected behavior.  'cycles' should use the
legacy and arm_blah/cycles/ for sysfs.  Users on the platform knows the
legacy encoding is broken, and they use the sysfs.

But maybe I'm wrong and it's better to make the tools smarter so that it
can just work with the default event (cycles:P).

I'd like to hear others' opinion on this.

Sorry for the distraction.  I meant users would learn the events from
`perf list` so it should guide them to use the event properly.  I
originally thought having PMU is the right thing, but for practical and
convenience reasons it'd be fine without PMUs.

Hmm.. right.  This is a concern.  I don't know.. let's listen to others
first.

Sorry, I meant people used to add a PMU prefix in the past.  But let's
move on and use wildcard. :)

I'm ok with preferring JSON over sysfs.  In general I think they don't
have the same event names unless you want to override one.
