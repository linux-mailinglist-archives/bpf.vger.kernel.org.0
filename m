Yeah, my hunch is that different deployments will have custom config
data and then getting the data into libxdp format will just be another
data conversion step. I could be wrong.

If it is decided to create a data format, then the JSON schema you
described is pretty much exactly what I had in mind, too. For whatever
that is worth!

Ah, yes, that perspective helps a lot; I understand much better why you
would want a centralized configuration file. My mind is actually kind of
melting now thinking about all the use cases.

Is the idea that the configuration file would have the final word? For
example, if there are multiple applications using libxdp (and possibly
even programatically overriding their priorities), could a sysadmin then
write a config file to dictate what they actually want? That would made
sense to me. If that's the goal, then I guess I would take back my
opinion about that policy not belonging in libxdp. I think application
writers would be less likely to use the configuration format (for
reasons we discussed above), but it does seem like a necessary mechanism
for sysadmins to orchestrate multiple applications that don't know about
each other. For my team's use case, we have the luxury of being the One
Application to rule all BPF programs.

We're a pretty huge organization... lots of DCs, public cloud, private
cloud, different kernel versions, sister companies, hundreds of
applications, etc. We want anyone to be able to write cool BPF programs
and userspace applications without needing awareness of what's running
before or after or if that order might change in the future. I'm sure
the desired order will be more obvious for some programs than others,
but we have administrators that can analyze the BPF programs, compose
multiple BPF programs together, and order and reorder them. We have a
team of people that can work with teams to resolve any interdependencies
if necessary.

As an example, we've done something similar for HTTP ingress and egress
Lua plugins in the past. We have dozens of teams that write Lua code to
do custom L7 things with HTTP requests and responses, and then we have a
UI where admins/ops folks can literally drag and drog the plugins into
the desired order. We wouldn't want teams making assumptions about what
order plugins should run in, either.

Hopefully that helps!

Thanks again,
Brian
