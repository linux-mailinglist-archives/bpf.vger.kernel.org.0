Meh, taking tid here feels like the 'old-school' approach, before recent
efforts to teach the verifier more about resource acquisition, locking,
iteration, trustedness, etc. All allowing us to push more important logic
out of 'opaque' helper impl and into BPF programs.

In this tid -> struct task_struct case I think the provided resource acquisition 
is sufficient. Using your examples:

  * We have a TRUSTED or RCU struct task_struct
    * No need to do anything, can pass to bpf_iter_task_vma_new

  * We have a struct task_struct, but it's UNTRUSTED or has no trustedness
    type flags
    * Use bpf_task_acquire or bpf_task_from_pid

  * We just have a pid ('coming from outside')
    * Use bpf_task_from_pid

If there is some scenario where we can't get from pid to properly acquired task
in the BPF program, let's improve the resource acquisition instead of pushing
it into the kfunc impl.

Also, should we look up (and refcount incr) the task using task->rcu_users
refcount w/ bpf_task_{acquire,release}, or using task->usage refcount w/ 
{get,put}_task_struct ? More generally, if there are >1 valid ways to acquire
task_struct or some other resource, pushing acquisition to the BPF program
gives us the benefit of not having to pick one (or do possibly ugly / complex
flags). As long as type flags express that the resource will not go away,
this kfunc impl can ignore the details of how that property came about.
