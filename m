yep. No UX concerns. A comment to manage expectations should be enough.

Great. Thanks for checking. I was worried that attr(cleanup) will force compiler to think
that different objects cannot reuse the stack slots which will lead to stack exhaustion.
Especially with 24-bytes bpf_iter-s and our tiny 512 limit.

It feels that the proposed bpf_repeat() without 'i' is cleaner.

typo. I meant the same var in both places.

I see. Abusing bpf_iter like:
for (struct bpf_iter_num __it, *___p, start_end = (struct bpf_iter_num) {start, end};
is probably too ugly just to READ_ONCE(start).
Especially since bpf_iter_num is opaque.

Please add a comment to warn users that if start/end are variables they
better not change during bpf_for().
I guess plain C loop: for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) will go crazy too if 'j' changes.
I'm not sure what standard says here.
Whether compiler has to reload 'j' every iteration or not.

Understood. Keep it as-is.

btw that 'nothing here' comment is distracting when reading this macro.
