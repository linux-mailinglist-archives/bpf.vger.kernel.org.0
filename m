This patch set proposes the addition of a new way for performing type queries to
BPF. It introduces the "type matches" relation, similar to what is already
present with "type exists" (in the form of bpf_core_type_exists).

"type exists" performs fairly superficial checking, mostly concerned with
whether a type exists in the kernel and is of the same kind (enum/struct/...).
Notably, compatibility checks for members of composite types is lacking.

The newly introduced "type matches" (bpf_core_type_matches) fills this gap in
that it performs stricter checks: compatibility of members and existence of
similarly named enum variants is checked as well. E.g., given these definitions:

	struct task_struct___og { int pid; int tgid; };

	struct task_struct___foo { int foo; }

'task_struct___og' would "match" the kernel type 'task_struct', because the
members match up, while 'task_struct___foo' would not match, because the
kernel's 'task_struct' has no member named 'foo'.

More precisely, the "type match" relation is defined as follows (copied from
source):
- modifiers and typedefs are stripped (and, hence, effectively ignored)
- generally speaking types need to be of same kind (struct vs. struct, union
  vs. union, etc.)
  - exceptions are struct/union behind a pointer which could also match a
    forward declaration of a struct or union, respectively, and enum vs.
    enum64 (see below)
Then, depending on type:
- integers:
  - match if size and signedness match
- arrays & pointers:
  - target types are recursively matched
- structs & unions:
  - local members need to exist in target with the same name
  - for each member we recursively check match unless it is already behind a
    pointer, in which case we only check matching names and compatible kind
- enums:
  - local variants have to have a match in target by symbolic name (but not
    numeric value)
  - size has to match (but enum may match enum64 and vice versa)
- function pointers:
  - number and position of arguments in local type has to match target
  - for each argument and the return value we recursively check match

Enabling this feature requires a new relocation to be made known to the
compiler. This is being taken care of for LLVM as part of
https://reviews.llvm.org/D126838.

If applied, among other things, usage of this functionality could have helped
flag issues such as the one discussed here
https://lore.kernel.org/all/93a20759600c05b6d9e4359a1517c88e06b44834.camel@fb.com/
earlier.
