Yes, that's right. This is the model we are implementing.

I would just say that in our organizations network and administration
environment, we ideally want a centralized orchestration tooling and
control plane that is used for all XDP (and tc) programs running on our
machines with our model described above.

That said, I do see your point about the possibility of using some other
application that runs its own XDP programs, and then, yes, we would
definitely want some way to control the priority. Ideally, the
application would have its own configuration to set priorities, but I do
think the system configuration file is a good way to ensure that the
sysadmin does have the power to override if necessary.

I think you're right that both models should be able to be used. Thanks
for the good discussion.

Thanks,
Brian
