I don't think this is a good reason, this corners you into UAPI which
later on cannot be changed anymore. If you encounter such issues, then
why not bringing up actual concrete examples / limitations you run into
to the BPF community and help one way or another to get the verifier
improved instead? (Again, see sched_ext as one example improving verifier,
but also concrete example bug reports, etc could help.)

So parser at XDP, but then you push it up the stack (instead of staying
only at XDP layer) just to reach into tc layer to perform a corresponding
action.. and this just to work around verifier as you say?

So it is even worse from a design PoV. The kernel side allows XDP program
to be passed to cls_p4, but then it's not doing anything but holding a
reference to that BPF program. Iow, you need anyway to go the regular way
of bpf_xdp_link_attach() or dev_change_xdp_fd() to install XDP. Why is the
reference even needed here, why it cannot be done in user space from your
control plane? This again, feels like a shim layer which should live in
user space instead.

There is nothing specific to k8s, it's generic infrastructure for tc BPF
and also used outside of k8s scope; please double-check the selftests to
get a picture of the API and libbpf integration.

Not really, the infrastructure is already there and ready to be used and
it supports basic building blocks such as BPF links, relative prog/link
dependency resolution, etc, where none of it can be found here. The
problem is "we want to use netlink" which is even why you need to push
down things like XDP prog, but it's broken by design, really. You are
trying to push down a control plane into netlink which should have been
a framework in user space.
