I get your point. The current implementation of BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_BATCH
does the following two things:
1) returns 0 when the whole map has not been iterated but there is no
space for current bucket.
2) doesn't return 0 when the whole map has been iterated successfully
(and the requested count is fulfilled)

For 1) I prefer to update the comments in uapi. If instead we fix the
implementation, we may break the existed users which need to check
ENOSPC to continue the batch op.
For 2) I don't have a preference. Both updating the comments and
implementation are fine to me.

WDYT ?
