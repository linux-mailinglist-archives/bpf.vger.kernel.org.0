It could act like an earlier early-demux for established sk? If the bpf prog has 
already looked up an established sk for other needs (eg. reading the sk local 
storage), it may as well bpf_sk_assign it to the skb. I don't have a use case 
for that but I also don't see why it won't work also.

yeah, probably adding sk_fullsock() is needed, may be something like(?):

	if (!prefetched || !sk_fullsock(sk))
                 return sk;
