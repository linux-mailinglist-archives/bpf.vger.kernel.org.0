BPF selftests mandate certain kernel configuration options to be present in
order to pass. Currently the "reference" config files containing these options
are hosted in a separate repository [0]. From there they are picked up by the
BPF continuous integration system as well as the in-tree vmtest.sh helper
script, which allows for running tests in a VM-based setup locally.

But it gets worse, as "BPF CI" is really two CI systems: one for libbpf
(mentioned above) and one for the bpf-next kernel repository (or more precisely:
family of repositories, as bpf-rc is using the system). As such, we have an
additional -- and slightly divergent -- copy of these configurations.

This patch set proposes the merging of said configurations into this repository.
Doing so provides several benefits:
1) the vmtest.sh script is now self-contained, no longer requiring to pull
   configurations over the network
2) we can have a single copy of these configurations, eliminating the
   maintenance burden of keeping two versions in-sync
3) the kernel tree is the place where most development happens, so it is the
   most natural to adjust configurations as changes are proposed there, as
   opposed to out-of-tree, where they would always remain an afterthought

The patch set is structed in such a way that we first integrate the external
configuration [0] and then adjust the vmtest.sh script to pick up the local
configuration instead of reaching out to GitHub.

Changelog:
v1 -> v2:
- minimized imported kernel configs and made them build on top of existing
  tools/testing/selftests/bpf/config
  - moved them directly into tools/testing/selftests/bpf/
- sorted and cleaned up tools/testing/selftests/bpf/config
- removed "selftests/bpf: Integrate vmtest configs" from patch set
- removed 4.9 & 5.5 configs

Daniel MÃ¼ller (3):
  selftests/bpf: Sort configuration
  selftests/bpf: Copy over libbpf configs
  selftests/bpf: Adjust vmtest.sh to use local kernel configuration
