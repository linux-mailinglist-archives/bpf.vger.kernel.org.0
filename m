I mentioned options that we discussed before in the cover letter.

Basically, pahole needs to figure out how many arguments to omit *somehow*.
Using a name suffix (aka annotation) seems to be the most flexible way, as
it allows to avoid changes in pahole if/when we add new implicit arg types.

I think some kind of build-time enforcement will be necessary.
It's *very* easy to unintentionally use old(-er) pahole version
for kernel build, especially when the new version is recent.
