Hi all,

We are pleased to announce the Call for Participation (CfP) for the FOSDEM
2024 Kernel Devroom.

FOSDEM 2024 will be over the weekend of the 3rd and 4th of February in
Brussels, Belgium.  FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by
the community for the community.  The goal is to provide free and open
source software developers and communities a place to meet to:

- get in touch with other developers and projects;
- be informed about the latest developments in the free software world;
- be informed about the latest developments in the open source world;
- attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project
   leaders and committers;
- to promote the development and benefits of free software and open source
   solutions.
- Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organisers
   gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.

## Format

The Kernel Devroom will be running an all day, exact day and time will be
clarified in the near future..

We’re looking for talk or demo proposals in one of the following 4 sizes:

- 10 minutes (e.g., a short demo)
- 20 minutes (e.g., a project update)
- 30 minutes (e.g., introduction to a new technology or a deep dive on a
   complex feature)
- 40 minutes (e.g., a deep dive on a complex feature)

In all cases, please allow for at least 5 minutes of questions (10min
preferred for the 30min slots).  In general, shorter content will be more
likely to get approved as we want to cover a wide range of topics.

## Proposals

Proposals should be sent through the FOSDEM scheduling system at:
https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2024/cfp

Please select the "Kernel" as the __track__ and ensure you include the
following information when submitting a proposal:

| Section |  Field       |  Notes                                                                             |

| Event   |  Event Title |  *This is the title of your talk* - please be descriptive to encourage attendance. |
| Event   |  Abstract    |  Short abstract of one or two paragraphs.                                          |
| Event   |  Duration    |  Please indicate the length of your talk; 10 min, 20 min, 30, or 40 min            |

__The CfP deadline is Saturday, 10 December 2024.__

## Topics

The Kernel Devroom aims to cover a wide range of different topics so don't
be shy. The following list should just serve as an inspiration:

- Filesystems and Storage
- io_uring
- Tracing
- eBPF
- Fuzzing
- System Boot
- Security
- Virtualization
- Rust in the Linux Kernel

## Code of Conduct

We'd like to remind all speakers and attendees that all of the
presentations and discussions in our devroom are held under the guidelines
set in the [FOSDEM Code of
Conduct](https://fosdem.org/2024/practical/conduct/) and we expect
attendees, speakers, and volunteers to follow the CoC at all times.

If you submit a proposal and it is accepted, you will be required to
confirm that you accept the FOSDEM CoC. If you have any questions about the
CoC or wish to have one of the devroom organizers review your presentation
slides or any other content for CoC compliance, please email us and we will
do our best to assist you.

An up to date version of the CfP can always be found at

Thanks!
