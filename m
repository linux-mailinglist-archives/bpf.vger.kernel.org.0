Okay. The following in uapi bpf.h:

/* BPF_FUNC_perf_event_output for sk_buff input context. */
         BPF_F_CTXLEN_MASK               = (0xfffffULL << 32),

That is why I missed it since it is for networking side of perf_event_output.

The networking flavored bpf_perf_event_output tries to output
networking packets plus meta data. It is a little bit different
from tracing side of bpf_perf_event_output.
Unfortunately, we do not have a good documentation for this yet.
