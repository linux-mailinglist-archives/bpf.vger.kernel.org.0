Note, you can detect dropped events. If there's a dropped event, you can
ignore the "missing end" from a beginning. You could also make synthetic
events that pair an end event with a beginning event (which uses the last
begin event found). Synthetic event creation is not affected by dropped
events.

There's a lot you can to get information with the prospect of dropped
events. I would not use that as rationale for not using events.
