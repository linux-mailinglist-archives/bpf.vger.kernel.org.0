Yes, and the xdp-newsbies is an even better list for these kinds of
discussions (added).

In other words, you are using shared umem sockets. The 4 sockets can
potentially receive packets from queue 0, depending on how the XDP
program is done.

You are right that the AF_XDP functionality in libbpf is *not* by
itself multi-process/thread safe, and this is deliberate. From the
libbpf perspective we cannot know how a user will construct the
application, and we don't want to penalize the single-thread/process
case.

It's entirely up to you to add explicit locking, if the
single-producer/single-consumer queues are shared between
threads/processes. Explicit synchronization is required using, say,
POSIX mutexes.

Does that clear things up?
