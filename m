Hm, but that was also either way in the original rfc.

Yeah that can be done.

Why it's needed, do you have a use case for it?

It didn't compile for me, but if you think it's a better approach, yes,
feel free to post it as a proper patch then.

What I'm not quite following though is, I thought your original use case
was that you want to be able to troubleshoot drops from unexpected
locations (aka not policy) in the tc engine so won't this miss cases when
you would then want to use tcf_set_drop_reason() e.g. from tcf_action_exec()
upon 'exception' cases (like the one for example I pointed out)? With the
diff you proposed it will basically fallback to SKB_DROP_REASON_TC_{INGRESS,
EGRESS}, so override anything that would have been set from there.

Thanks,
Daniel
