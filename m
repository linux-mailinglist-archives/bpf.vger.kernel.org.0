Attention: Beneficiary,

This is to bring to your notice that because of the impossibility of
your fund transfer through our western union network, we have credited
your total fund of $15,500,000.00 into an ATM VISA card,and we have
paid the delivery fee of your ATM VISA card for you, we paid it
because your ATM VISA card worth of $15,500,000.00 which we have
registered for deliver, has less than 16 days to expire in the custody
of the UPS Company and when it expires, the money will go into federal
government treasury account.

For that we decided to help you pay off the money so that your ATM
VISA card will not expire, because we trust that when you receive this
your ATM VISA card, definitely you must pay us back and even
compensate us for helping you. Like we stated earlier, the delivery
charges has been paid ,therefore the only money you were advice to
send to them is their official security keeping fees of $25usd every
day.

Like I stated earlier, the crediting re-activation, delivery and the
company registration charges has been paid by me, but I  did not pay
their official security keeping fees since they refused, they refused
and the reason is that they do not know when you are going to contact
them and the demurrage might have increased by then, They told me that
their official  security keeping fees is $$25.00 per a day , and I
deposited it yesterday by 10:am in the morning to their office.

Therefore you should contact them with the below contact information;


Contact person name: (Victor nelson)

Try to contact them today and also send them the official security
keeping charge to avoid increasing of their fee and let me know once

Contact them today with your full information requested below;

Try to indicate all this codes to them because it will prove that you

custody.
