[ Upstream commit f41345f47fb267a9c95ca710c33448f8d0d81d83 ]

In the following toy program (reg states minimized for readability), R0
and R1 always have different values at instruction 6. This is obvious
when reading the program but cannot be guessed from ranges alone as
they overlap (R0 in [0; 0xc0000000], R1 in [1024; 0xc0000400]).

  0: call bpf_get_prandom_u32#7  ; R0_w=scalar()
  1: w0 = w0                     ; R0_w=scalar(var_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff))
  2: r0 >>= 30                   ; R0_w=scalar(var_off=(0x0; 0x3))
  3: r0 <<= 30                   ; R0_w=scalar(var_off=(0x0; 0xc0000000))
  4: r1 = r0                     ; R1_w=scalar(var_off=(0x0; 0xc0000000))
  5: r1 += 1024                  ; R1_w=scalar(var_off=(0x400; 0xc0000000))
  6: if r1 != r0 goto pc+1

Looking at tnums however, we can deduce that R1 is always different from
R0 because their tnums don't agree on known bits. This patch uses this
logic to improve is_scalar_branch_taken in case of BPF_JEQ and BPF_JNE.

This change has a tiny impact on complexity, which was measured with
the Cilium complexity CI test. That test covers 72 programs with
various build and load time configurations for a total of 970 test
cases. For 80% of test cases, the patch has no impact. On the other
test cases, the patch decreases complexity by only 0.08% on average. In
the best case, the verifier needs to walk 3% less instructions and, in
the worst case, 1.5% more. Overall, the patch has a small positive
impact, especially for our largest programs.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

**YES**

## Extensive Analysis

After conducting a thorough investigation of this commit, I recommend
backporting it to stable kernel trees. Here's my detailed analysis:

### **Nature of the Change**

This commit introduces a new `tnum_overlap()` helper function and uses
it to improve the BPF verifier's branch-taken analysis for JEQ
(equality) and JNE (inequality) operations. The implementation:

1. **Adds `tnum_overlap()` in kernel/bpf/tnum.c (lines 147-153)**:
  ```c
  bool tnum_overlap(struct tnum a, struct tnum b)
  {
  u64 mu;
  mu = ~a.mask & ~b.mask;  // Bits known in both tnums
  return (a.value & mu) == (b.value & mu);  // Do known bits agree?
  }
  ```

2. **Uses it in `is_scalar_branch_taken()` in kernel/bpf/verifier.c**:
   - For `BPF_JEQ`: If `!tnum_overlap(t1, t2)`, return 0 (values can
     never be equal, branch not taken)
   - For `BPF_JNE`: If `!tnum_overlap(t1, t2)`, return 1 (values always
     different, branch taken)

### **Why This Matters - Bug Fix, Not Just Optimization**

While the commit message describes this as an "improvement" and
discusses complexity reduction, **the accompanying selftest (commit
0780f54ab129b) reveals this actually fixes verification failures**:

```
6: if r1 != r0 goto pc+1
7: r10 = 0
   frame pointer is read only  ← ERROR without the patch
```

The test shows a program that **fails verification** without this patch
because the verifier explores unreachable code (instruction 7) that
tries to modify the frame pointer. With the patch, the verifier
correctly identifies the code as dead and allows the program to load.

### **Technical Correctness**

The `tnum_overlap()` logic is mathematically sound:

- **Tnums (tracked numbers)** represent knowledge about bits: each bit
  is either known (value=0/1, mask=0) or unknown (mask=1)
- **`mu = ~a.mask & ~b.mask`** extracts bits that are **known in both**
  tnums
- **`(a.value & mu) == (b.value & mu)`** checks if those known bits have
  the same value
- If any known bit disagrees, the tnums can never be equal

This is a **pure refinement** - it adds precision without changing the
correctness of the analysis. It can only make `is_branch_taken()` more
accurate, never less.

### **Historical Context and Related Issues**

This commit is part of an evolution of branch-taken logic:

1. **November 2023 (be41a203bb9e0)**: "enhance BPF_JEQ/BPF_JNE
   is_branch_taken logic"
   - Explicitly stated as "**necessary to prevent correctness issue**"
   - Prevents invalid ranges (min > max) in `set_range_min_max()`

2. **July 2025 (6279846b9b25)**: "Forget ranges when refining tnum after
   JSET"
   - Fixes syzbot-reported range invariant violation
   - Notes "is_branch_taken() isn't currently able to figure this out"

3. **August 2025 (f41345f47fb26)**: **This commit**
   - Further improves `is_branch_taken()` precision using tnums
   - Prevents verification failures shown in the selftest

### **Code Changes Analysis**

The diff shows:

1. **include/linux/tnum.h**: Adds `tnum_overlap()` declaration (3 lines)
2. **kernel/bpf/tnum.c**: Implements `tnum_overlap()` (8 lines)
3. **kernel/bpf/verifier.c**: Uses `tnum_overlap()` in two places (4
   lines)

**Total: 15 lines added** - a small, self-contained change.

The placement in the code is strategically correct:
- For `BPF_JEQ`: Check `tnum_overlap()` **before** range checks, as an
  early exit when tnums definitively prove inequality
- For `BPF_JNE`: Check `tnum_overlap()` **before** range checks, as an
  early confirmation when tnums definitively prove inequality

### **Testing and Validation**

The commit includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Selftests** (tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/verifier_bounds.c):
   - `jne_disagreeing_tnums`: Tests JNE with non-overlapping tnums
   - `jeq_disagreeing_tnums`: Tests JEQ with non-overlapping tnums

2. **Real-world validation** (Cilium complexity CI):
   - 72 programs, 970 test cases
   - 80% no impact
   - 20% with 0.08% average complexity reduction
   - Best case: 3% fewer instructions walked
   - Worst case: 1.5% more instructions walked

### **Risk Assessment**

**Very Low Risk:**

1. **No follow-up fixes found**: Searched commits through September
   2025, no "Fixes:" tags or bug reports
2. **Simple, auditable logic**: The `tnum_overlap()` implementation is
   straightforward bitwise operations
3. **Pure refinement**: Can only improve precision, cannot break
   existing correct behavior
4. **Well-tested**: Has dedicated selftests and passed Cilium CI
5. **No architectural changes**: Doesn't modify core verifier structures
   or algorithms

### **Backport Suitability**

This commit meets all stable tree criteria:

✅ **Fixes important bugs**: Prevents verification failures for
legitimate BPF programs
✅ **Small and contained**: Only 15 lines added across 3 files
✅ **No new features**: Improves existing verifier logic
✅ **Minimal regression risk**: Pure refinement with comprehensive tests
✅ **Confined to subsystem**: Only touches BPF verifier code

### **Conclusion**

**This should be backported.** Despite being described as an
optimization, it actually **prevents verification failures** for valid
BPF programs, as demonstrated by the selftest that would fail with
"frame pointer is read only" error without this patch. The change is
small, well-tested, mathematically correct, and has no known issues. It
follows the pattern of similar correctness fixes (be41a203bb9e0) in the
same code area and helps prevent the kinds of range invariant violations
that were reported to syzbot (6279846b9b25).
