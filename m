Dear Sir/ Madam,

Please forgive me if my request is not acceptable by your kind person,
I got your email contact from Google peoples search.

I am Mrs. Najwa Myra Ikmal, Working at MAYBANK (Malaysia) as the
Non-Independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman of Maybank. During
our last year banking Audits we discovered an abandoned account
belongs to our deceased customer late Mr. Tambi Jiee who died along
with his entire family in the Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash.

I am writing to request your assistance in transferring the sum of
$11.5 Million (Eleven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars) into your account for public benefit as follows;

(1) Establish An Orphanage Home To Help The Orphanages Children.

(2) Building A Nursing Home For Poor Widows and Elderly People Need
Care & Meal Support.

(3) Invest into Real Estate for supporting the above projects.

Meanwhile, I want you to understand that before I contacted you I have
done personal investigation in locating any of Late Mr. Tambi Jiee
relatives who knows about the account, but I came out unsuccessful. I
also want you to understand that I have made every necessary
arrangement with my colleagues in transferring the fund through ONLINE
BANKING Transfer into your nominated bank account without any problem
or trouble in the future.


I am willing to offer you 40% from the total fund for your support and
assistant in transferring the fund into your account.  More detailed
information will be forwarded to you to break down, explaining
comprehensively what is required of you.

Waiting for your urgent reply,
Best regards
Mrs. Najwa Myra Ikmal.
