OK, so this part is admittedly a little hand-wavy and a work in
progress. We're literally working on design and proof of concepts right
now, but this is basically what we're envisioning:

1. Orchestration tool gets all its JSON config data, which includes
   remote paths for BPF programs and any respective userspace
   programs.
2. Orchestration tool downloads BPF programs and loads them (using
   Go libxdp when it's available). Then (and this is where I'm going to
   start waving my hands) the orchestrator will need to gather any
   necessary map names/ids/fds information to be send to the userspace
   program. I'm just not exactly sure how easy/hard/possible this part
   is.
3. We start the userspace programs as separate processes and communicate
   with them via RPC (there's a nice Go plugin system for this[1]). Each
   userspace program implements an interface and we communicate the map
   info (among other things) over RPC to the userspace program when it
   starts.

I'm going to continue researching and fleshing out the details, but are
there any obvious problems with this approach? A backup plan is to have
the userspace programs do the loading of the BPF program, but it's not
obvious to me how that would be easier to obtain the file descriptor for
the map(s) vs. having the orchestrator figure it out and send it to the
userspace process.

If it works out that the orchestrator can load the BPF programs on
behalf of the userspace programs, then I think the primary benefit is
that the developer of the userspace program doesn't need to follow some
boilerplate to load the appropriate way--we've done all that for them.
It seems nice that the orchestrator could be the one interface with
libxdp (for the XDP case) without every userspace program needing to
doing it's own adding/removing (and thus dispatcher swapping), though I
would guess that's not really a problem at all.

I feel like I've gone out of the scope of libxdp in this e-mail, but you
did ask :) And I do appreciate any feedback or raising of red flags.

Thanks,
Brian
