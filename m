A commercial distro does not care about problems that are caused by
using kernel modules that are not included in that distro's kernels.

Those who supply kernel modules that are not included in that distro's
kernels (e.g. antivirus software vendors) care about problems that are
caused by using such kernel modules.

Kernel modules for hardware devices that are not included in that distro's
kernels can be appended after boot.

Kernel modules for filesystems that are not included in that distro's
kernels can be appended after boot.

If a commercial distro does not want to allow use of kernel modules that
are not included in that distro's kernels, that distro would enforce module
signature verification rather than disabling loadable module support.
Keeping loadable module support enabled is a balance that is important for
getting wider developers/users.

LSM modules that are not built into vmlinux currently cannot be appended
after boot. Such asymmetry is strange and remains a big barrier.

You are not concerned about this asymmetry, but I am very much concerned.
Please give me feedback on not "I don't need it" but "how we can do it".
