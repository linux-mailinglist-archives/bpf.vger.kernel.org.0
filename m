Ah, so there is a plan to eventually add HW offload support for cls_p4?
Or is this only specifiying a location of a blob through some opaque
cookie value from user space?

My question on the above is mainly what does it bring you to hold a
reference on the XDP program? There is no guarantee that something else
will get loaded onto XDP, and then eventually the cls_p4 is the only
entity holding the reference but w/o 'purpose'. We do have BPF links
and the user space component orchestrating all this needs to create
and pin the BPF link in BPF fs, for example. An artificial reference
on XDP prog feels similar as if you'd hold a reference on an inode
out of tc.. Again, that should be delegated to the control plane you
have running interacting with the compiler which then manages and
loads its artifacts. What if you would also need to set up some
netfilter rules for the SW pipeline, would you then embed this too?

Thanks,
Daniel
