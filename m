I understand the generic pain points from your other email. But could
you be more specific for the case of bpftool? It's not like we're
shipping all lib dependencies as submodules. Sync-ups are specifically
aligned to the same commit used to sync the libbpf mirror, so that it's
pretty much as if we had the right version of the library shipped in the
repository - only, it's one --recurse-submodules away.

True in this case, and this is something that needs to get fixed. Thanks
for reopening that thread! Are you building bpftool on kernels older
than 5.15? (genuine curiosity)

Of course it does. Libbpf exposes a specific set of functions to user
applications.

But correct, from bpftool's perspective, there are a few locations where
we accept to derogate and to access to the internals directly, making it
more dependent on a specific version, or commit, of libbpf, and blurring
the notion of API.

This special relationship is nothing new though, and it has been
discussed before. It derives from both tools being developed in the same
repository, and bpftool being so tightly linked to libbpf - it has been
qualified of command-line interface for libbpf in the past. Bpftool's
version number itself is aligned on libbpf's. (As a side note, bpftool
used to pull libbpf's headers directly from libbpf's dir instead of
installing them locally, which facilitated this mix-in for
public/internal headers in the first place.)

I know you advocated making the required functions part of the API,
given that some users (such as bpftool) need them. These functions are
not exposed, by choice. They are not judged relevant to generic user
space application (I'm sure libbpf's maintainers are opened to
discussion if use cases come up). Some of the internals we get from
libbpf are also mostly to avoid re-implementing things, such as netlink
attributes processing, or implementing hash maps. These have nothing to
do in libbpf's API.

Not discussing that - My point is that I've received little feedback on
the mirror so far, so it's hard for me to figure out who's using it or
whether anyone has been reading the changelogs.

Just as you said yourself, the missing stability is in the way. I don't
see this happening as long as bpftool is using libbpf's internals. I do
expect builds to work most of the time by copying the headers as you
did, but as soon as something changes and it no longer does, everyone
will start filing issues on GitHub instead of using the version that
works, and I don't want that.

As for decoupling from the internal: making the functions part of the
API is not an option. One option could be to move this code into further
dependencies shared between libbpf and bpftool - although I guess libbpf
developers will have little appetite for that. We could also duplicate
the necessary code in bpftool, which doesn't sound optimal, but might be
one solution. Other options have been discussed before, such as moving
bpftool into libbpf's directory/mirror and shipping both together, but
there was no consensus at the time, and I don't expect libbpf to ship
with bpftool any time soon.
