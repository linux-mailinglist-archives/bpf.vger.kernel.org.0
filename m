Looking at this a little because I have a few minutes.
What's all this unused code?

static inline struct user_event_group
*user_event_group_from_user_ns(struct user_namespace *user_ns)
{
        if (user_ns == &init_user_ns)
                return init_group;

        return NULL;
}

static struct user_event_group *current_user_event_group(void)
{
        struct user_namespace *user_ns = current_user_ns();
        struct user_event_group *group = NULL;

        while (user_ns) {
                group = user_event_group_from_user_ns(user_ns);

                if (group)
                        break;

                user_ns = user_ns->parent;
        }

        return group;
}

User namespaces form strict hierarchies so you always end up at
init_user_ns no matter where you start from in the hierarchy. Return the
init_group and delete that code above.

static char *user_event_group_system_name(struct user_namespace *user_ns)
{
        char *system_name;
        int len = sizeof(USER_EVENTS_SYSTEM) + 1;

        if (user_ns != &init_user_ns) {
                /*
                 * Unexpected at this point:
                 * We only currently support init_user_ns.
                 * When we enable more, this will trigger a failure so log.
                 */
                pr_warn("user_events: Namespace other than init_user_ns!\n");
                return NULL;
        }

Your delegation model is premised on file permissions of a single file
in global tracefs. It won't work with user namespaces so let's not give
the false impression that this is on the table.

Plus, all of this is also called in a single place during
trace_events_user_init() which is called from fs_initcall() so you
couldn't even pass a different user namespace if you wanted to because
only init_user_ns exists.
