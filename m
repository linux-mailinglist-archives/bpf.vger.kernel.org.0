You're right -- I had misunderstood that the emulation happened during
handling of the breakpoint, rather than on the return-to-userspace path.
Looking at the arm64 entry code, the way uprobe_notify_resume() is
plumbed in is safe as it happens after we've re-enabled preemption and
unmasked other exceptions.

Sorry about that.

For the moment I'd still prefer to get the NOP case out of the way
first, so I'll review the NOP-only patch shortly.

Mark.
