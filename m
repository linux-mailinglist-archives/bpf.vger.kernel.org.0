Thanks for the detailed review. You're right, without adding a new
instruction non-kernel observers can't distinguish between a JA and a
"static branch JA". This also makes sense to encode direct/inverse flag as
well (and more, see below). I would call the new instruction something like
JA_CFG, emphasizing the fact that this is a JA which can be configured by
an external force.

We also can easily add a kfunc API, however, I am for keeping the "map API"
in place (in addition to more fine-grained API you've proposed). See my
considerations and examples below.

Here is how I think about API. Imagine that we have this new instruction,
JA_CFG, and that a program uses it in multiple places. If we don't mark
those instructions, then after compilation an external observer can't
distinguish between them. We don't know if this is supposed to be
instructions controlled by one key or another. We may care about this, say,
when a program uses key A for enabling/disabling debug and key B to
enable/disable another optional feature.

If we push offsets of jumps in a separate section via the "'.long 1b - .'
asm trick", then we will have all the same problems with relocations which
is fragile, as you've shown. What we can do instead is to encode "local key
id" inside the instruction. This local_id is local to the program where it
is used. (We can use 4 bits in, say, dst_reg, or 16 bits of unused
offset/imm, as one of them will be unused. As for me, 4 may be enough for
the initial implementation.) This way we can distinguish between different
keys in one program, and a new `bpf_static_key_set_prog(prog, key_id, value)`
kfunc can be used to toggle this key on/off for a particular program. This
way we don't care about relocation, and API is straightforward.

However, if this is the only API we provide, then this makes user's life
hard, as they will have to keep track of ids, and programs used, and
mapping from "global" id to local ids for each program (when multiple
programs use the same static key, which is desirable). If we keep the
higher-level "map API", then this simplifies user's life: on a program load
a user can send a list of (local_id -> map) mappings, and then toggle all
the branches controlled by "a [global] static key" by either

    bpf(MAP_UPDATE_ELEM, map, value)

or

    kfunc bpf_static_key_set(map, value)

whatever is more useful. (I think that keeping the bpf(2) userspace API is
worth doing it, as otherwise this, again, makes life harder: users would
have to recompile/update iterator programs if new programs using a static
key are added, etc.)

Libbpf can simplify life even more by automatically allocating local ids
and passing mappings to kernel for a program from the
`bpf_static_branch_{unlikely,likely}(&map)`, so that users don't ever thing
about this, if don't want to. Again, no relocations are required here.

So, to summarize:

  * A new instruction BPF_JA_CFG[ID,FLAGS,OFFSET] where ID is local to the
    program, FLAGS is 0/1 for normal/inverse branches

  * A new kfunc `bpf_static_key_set_prog(prog, key_id, value)` which
    toggles all the branches with ID=key_id in the given prog

  * Extend bpf_attr with a list of (local_id -> map) mappings. This is an
    optinal list if user doesn't want one or all branches to be controlled
    by a map

  * A new kfunc `bpf_static_key_set(map, value)` which toggles all the
    static branches in all programs which use `map` to control branches

  * bpf(2, MAP_UPDATE_ELEM, map, value) acts as the previous kfunc, but in
    a single syscall without the requirement to create iterators
