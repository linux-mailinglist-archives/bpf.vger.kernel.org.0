+1, agree, and I implemented this suggestion in the v5.

It needs to be done after the pointers have been swapped by the mprog user.

I would like to keep it given e.g. when application comes up, fetches links
from bpffs and updates all its programs in place, then this is the replace
situation.

Agree, some may want to keep an empty bpf_mprog, others may want to
free it. I implemented it this way. I removed all the BPF_MPROG_*
return codes.

It is because users can still be inflight on the old mprog_entry so it
must come after the sync rcu where we drop ref for the delete case.

Thanks again,
