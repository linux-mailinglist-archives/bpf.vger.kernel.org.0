 I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of
health, since I myself are in a very critical health condition in
which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see
the next day. I'm Mrs. Helen John carlsen, wife of late Mrs. Helen
John carlsen, a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some
funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of($ 11.000.000,eleven
million dollars)my Doctor told me recently that I have serious
sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke
sickness.Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to a
good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct
herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this
money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also
build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late
husband if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that
the house of God is maintained.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death
so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not
have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want
your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to
execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the
fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your
reply.

Best Regards,

Mrs. Helen John carlsen,
