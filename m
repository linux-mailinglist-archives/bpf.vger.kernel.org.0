Thank you very much!

If it is indeed difficult with ringbuf, maybe I can implement a new type 
of bpf map based on relay interface [1]? e.g., init relay during map 
creating, write into it with bpf helper, and then user can access to it 
in filesystem. I think it will be a simple but useful map for 
overwritable data transfer.
