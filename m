If you think only about upstream then the version check is in most cases
good enough, but usually that's not the case and patches are backported
to downstream distributions as well.

Yes, that file was introduced in kernel 4.15 so there are some
limitations where the fix would be introspectable.

Perfect, in that case I would prefer if we could export it in
cgroup/features as it will be easier for user-space to figure out
whether it's safe to relay on proper cleanup behavior or not and
it will make downstream distributions life easier.

I'll try the patch today with libvirt setup.
