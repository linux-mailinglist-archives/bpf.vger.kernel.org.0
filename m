No you're not, I was just talking about what Daniel pointed out, that
when using a script using 'default,extra_feature' is more descriptive
than '+extra_feature', but you're right, for the kernel we go on adding
the features we need and older pahole versions will just ignore those.

The explanation you gave on this message is interesting to clarify when
'default' should be used and perhaps also use the kernel build process
needs/use of a list of features, etc. It would be good to have it in the
man page, can you provide a formal patch doing that?

Thanks,
