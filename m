We have been bitten by the IRQ-spinlock before, so I cannot disagree,
although for us removing atomic flushes and allowing the lock to be
dropped between CPU flushes seems to be good enough (for now).

When you say "exit", do you mean abort the whole thing, or just don't
spin for the lock but wait for the ongoing flush?

I personally don't like mem_cgroup_flush_stats_ratelimited() very
much, because it is time-based (unlike memcg_vmstats_needs_flush()),
and a lot of changes can happen in a very short amount of time.
However, it seems like for some workloads it's a necessary evil :/

I briefly looked into a global scheme similar to
memcg_vmstats_needs_flush() in core cgroups code, but I gave up
quickly. Different subsystems have different incomparable stats, so we
cannot have a simple magnitude of pending updates on a cgroup-level
that represents all subsystems fairly.

I tried to have per-subsystem callbacks to update the pending stats
and check if flushing is required -- but it got complicated quickly
and performance was bad.

At some point, having different rstat trees for different subsystems
was brought up. I never looked into actually implementing it, but I
suppose if we do that we have a generic scheme similar to
memcg_vmstats_needs_flush() that can be customized by each subsystem
in a clean performant way? I am not sure.

Exactly.

I wonder if it would be okay to just unconditionally drop the lock at
each CPU boundary. Would be interesting to experiment with this. One
disadvantage of the mutex in this case (imo) is that outside of the
percpu spinlock critical section, we don't really need to be holding
the global lock/mutex. So sleeping while holding it is not needed and
only introduces problems. Dropping the spinlock at each boundary seems
like a way to circumvent that.

If the problems you are observing are mainly on CPUs that are holding
the lock and flushing, I suspect this should greatly. If the problems
are mainly on CPUs spinning for the lock, I suspect it will still help
redistribute the lock (and IRQs disablement) more often, but not as
much.

Just to be clear, if the spinlock was to be converted to a mutex, or
to be dropped at each CPU boundary, do you still think such
ratelimiting is still needed to mitigate lock contention -- even if
the IRQs latency problem is fixed?
