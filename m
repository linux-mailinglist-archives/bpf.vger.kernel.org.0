The counter-argument is that cgroups are hierarchical and higher level
cgroups should be able to enforce the desired behavior for their
sub-trees. I'm not sure what's more important here and have to think
more about it.
Do you have an example when it might be important for container to not
pass to a higher level bpf handler?

Imagine bpf program which does nothing and simple returns 1. Imagine
it's loaded as a system-wide oom handler. This will effectively disable
the oom killer and lead to a potential deadlock on memory.
But it's a perfectly valid bpf program.
This is something I want to avoid (and it's a common practice with other
bpf programs).

What I do I also rely on the value of the oom control's field, which is
not accessible to the bpf program for write directly, but can be changed
by calling certain helper functions, e.g. bpf_oom_kill_process.

Btw in general in a containerized environment a bpf handler knows
nothing about bpf programs up in the cgroup hierarchy... So it only
knows whether it was able to free some memory or not.

It can! Not directly, but by controlling which kfuncs/helpers are
available to bpf programs.
I agree with you in principle re locks and necessary precaution here.

Thanks!
