OK, what currently happens is we have a separate, centralized Go web
service exposing an HTTP based API. When the sysadmin calls that API it
stores the config data in a database. Then, we have another service that
periodically queries the database and writes the config data to a
constant database (cdb) and stores that in blob storage. Then, there is
a service running on each node that periodically pulls down the latest
cdb. Our orchestration tool running on each node is watching for new
cdbs using inotify; when the tool sees a new CDB it loads the new
configuration data--which, for us, literally ends up just being JSON
data--and does anything that needs done.

I had omitted those details for a couple of reasons: First, it's kind of a
lot and I didn't know it would be helpful. Second, this is the way it
works currently because, for expediency, we leveraged the internal
ecosystem that was already setup. We will likely move away from it, at
least partially.

So, I think the important part is that our orchestration tool will
periodically get the config data in JSON format. A path to each BPF
program is in the config data and the orchestration tool downloads them
as needed. We may move to just including the BPF program binary in the
config data--TBD. Obviously, we aren't using libxdp yet, so our config
data doesn't have "run priority", instead the config data has the order
the BPF programs need to run, and BPF programs themselves have to do the
bpf_tail_call (and the orchestration tool does a bunch of complicated
orchestration to get the chain in the right order). The config data also
contains a bunch of other information to do the orchestration, e.g.,
interface, ingress or egress, tc or xdp, what userspace code to run and
any config values for that, etc.

Hopefully that answers your question, and sorry if it was too much
information :)

It seems like I must be missing something here, but my plan was to do
this all programmatically by calling libxdp functions from the
orchestration tool by 1) calling something like xdp_program__open_file()
to load the XDP program, and then 2) setting the run configuration by
calling something like xdp_program__set_run_prio() and
xdp_program__chain_call_enabled(), and 3) adding the programs to the
dispatcher and loading it.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I guess you're saying that it might be
worth creating an abstraction in libxdp where a user can pass in the
necessary config data and libxdp does the work, that I just summarized
in the previous paragraph, on the user's behalf. I can see how that
could be a useful abstraction.

I don't have super strong feelings about this, and there may be use
cases that I'm not thinking about, but my first thought would be to make
the format just be code in libxdp, and have the libxdp "abstraction"
function take an array of objects that contain the necessary data.

I know in a previous e-mail you mentioned having a config file with
priority overrides. That's just not a use case that our team would want
to use. And, my opinion would be that the program using libxdp should be
the one to implement that sort of policy; it keeps libxdp more simple
without needing to worry about parsing config files (and handling config
version changes in the code and the spec). For example, xdp-loader could
have a config file with priority overrides and people could use that
code if they wanted to do something similar.

Hopefully I'm even making sense, but like I said, I don't have strong
feelings about the format, as long as we are able to achieve our
required use case of programmatically setting the run configuration
values from a libxdp user program.

We explicitly do not want defaults set by program authors. We want that
policy to be completely in the hands of the orchestration environment.
