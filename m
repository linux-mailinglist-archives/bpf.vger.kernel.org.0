Good afternoon, my good friend.

How are you doing today? I've heard from you for a long time what's going on
Your side? Today I am very pleased to inform you of my success in
receipt of these hereditary funds, transferred with the cooperation of the new
partner from India Asia. He is Canadian, but lives in India, but currently
I come to India on investment projects with my share of the total
millions of dollars. Meanwhile, I have not forgotten your past efforts
and attempts
to help me pass on these hereditary remedies even though it failed
us sometime, I want you to contact my secretary in Lome, West Togo Republic
Africa, her name is the brand solomon, this is his email address (
solomonbrand003@gmail.com), ask her to contact Ecobank if I
kept $ 350,000.00 for your compensation, this compensation fund
for all past efforts and attempts to help me in the past
deal. I really appreciated your efforts at that time. feel so
free of charge, contact my secretary, Mr. Solomon Brand, and tell her where
Ecobank will transfer the total amount of 350,000 US dollars.

Please let me know immediately. Ecobank will transfer funds in the
amount of USD 350,000.00.
to my bank account, now I'm too busy because of
investment projects that I have with my new partner at hand, therefore
contact Mr. Solomon brand at his email address, he
immediately contact Ecobank on your behalf. Stay safe from Covid 19.

Respectfully,
Dr. robert anderson
