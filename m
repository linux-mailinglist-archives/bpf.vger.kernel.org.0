I don't think it's about failure behavior, the concern is the error
messages.  It can take too much screen space when users give a long list
of invalid events.  And unfortunately the current error message for
checking dmesg is not very helpful.

Anyway you can add this line too: "Use -v to see the details."

I think the error behavior is a part of this change.
