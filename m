typos in above?
r6 is precise and r7 is not precise.

the log is correct, thouhg.
r6_old = Pscalar which will go through check_ids() successfully and both are unbounded.
r7_old is not precise. different id-s don't matter and different ranges don't matter.

As another potential fix...
can we mark_chain_precision() right at the time of R1 = R2 when we do
src_reg->id = ++env->id_gen
and copy_register_state();
for both regs?

I think
if (rold->precise && !check_ids(rold->id, rcur->id, idmap))
would be good property to have.
I don't like u32_hashset either.
It's more or less saying that scalar id-s are incompatible with precision.

I hope we don't need to do:
+       u32 reg_ids[MAX_CALL_FRAMES];
for backtracking either.
Hacking id-s into jmp history is equally bad.

Let's figure out a minimal fix.
