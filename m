For disassembler, we have stx as well may use w* registers with alu32.
In llvm BPFDisassembler.cpp, we have

   if ((InstClass == BPF_LDX || InstClass == BPF_STX) &&
       getInstSize(Insn) != BPF_DW &&
       (InstMode == BPF_MEM || InstMode == BPF_ATOMIC) &&
       STI.hasFeature(BPF::ALU32))
     Result = decodeInstruction(DecoderTableBPFALU3264, Instr, Insn, 
Address,
                                this, STI);
   else
     Result = decodeInstruction(DecoderTableBPF64, Instr, Insn, Address, 
this,
                                STI);

Maybe we should just do

   Result = decodeInstruction(DecoderTableBPF64, Instr, Insn, Address, 
this, STI);

So we already disassemble based on non-alu32 mode?
