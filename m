ftrace calls also schedule_on_each_cpu(ftrace_sync) to handle
situations where RCU is not watching, see rcu_is_watching().

The following is called in ftrace_shutdown():

	schedule_on_each_cpu(ftrace_sync);

	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PREEMPTION))
		synchronize_rcu_tasks();

	arch_ftrace_trampoline_free(ops);
