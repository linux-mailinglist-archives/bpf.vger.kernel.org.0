Nice idea on the struct_group()-like approach, but agree that this is
going to be tough given we need to divert anonymous and named parts as
you mention. One other wild thought ... we remove the bpf_attr entirely
from the uapi header, and have a kernel/bpf/bpf.cmd description and
generate the bpf_attr into a uapi header via script which the main header
can include. Kind of similar to the suggestion, but more flexible than
macro magic. We also have things like syscall table header generated via
script.. so it wouldn't be first. Still doesn't remove the eyesore, just
packages it differently. ;/

Thanks,
Daniel
