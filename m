It is a very joyful thing to break this good news to you.


I want to inform you that I have successfully got this fund
transferred by a French woman.
I am happy to write to you again and also thank you for the past
effort in which you tried helping me then Despite you being unable to
complete the transaction. Now I have secured your draft compensation
check by myself and it is now transformed to an ATM Visa Card.

I want to make it clear to you that no matter what, Your good heart to
me will never be forgotten by me because you are a good person. I am
happy to inform you that I stayed one week in Benin Republic with my
partner when we came to visit the reverend father who assisted me by
introducing his friend who got this fund transferred.. I have returned
back with my partner to his country after our little visit to Africa.

Due to the limit of time, I used the little time I have to secure your
compensation money back into an ATM Visa Card so that it will not be a
stress for you to withdraw money anywhere you are in the whole world.
Till now dear, I still have the compensation money I left for you in
my heart, That is why I decided to visit the reverend father in Benin
Republic and also secure the money for you back in a visa card myself.
My partner is truly a jealous man and I do not want to offend him by
our e-mails because he now has access to my email.

Contact the DHL officer directly there in Benin Republic so that you
will get your visa card of $400,000.00 Dollars that I kept for you.

I issued the check and I instructed the bank to roll the funds on an
ATM card for security reasons, you can use the ATM card to withdraw
money from any ATM machine world wide with a maximum of $
10,000.00,USD daily.

This vow I made to myself about compensating you has been in my mind
and I want to fulfill it to you though I did not tell you what was in
my mind, the bank said that you can receive the card and use it
anywhere in the world. Contact the DHL office directly with this
information.



Now you need to contact (RUBEN MIKE) of DHL POST office outlet in
Benin Republic

Email Address:
(dhlofficepost@yahoo.com)


Contact him as soon as you read this mail and ask him to send you the
VISA CARD which I kept for you.



I appreciate your efforts at that time very much, That is why I tried
my best to do all I can to secure your compensation money into a visa
card so that you can withdraw your money in any ATM machine over there
in your country. Be informed that I have registered the VISA CARD with
your name and here is the SECURITY  NUMBER..
4714  2212  7059  8668


Thank you.

Yours Faithfully
Ruddi Rajj
