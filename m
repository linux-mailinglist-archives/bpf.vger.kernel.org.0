This is one big hammer that is really counterproductive in some fairly
common use cases. It's fine for assigning a full USB device to a VM, it
really isn't for gently removing "just that bit of interface" the user
is using while leaving the rest running.

If a USB device has 2 interfaces, and one of those interfaces is used
by a kernel driver, or a system-wide application, then the whole USB
device is made unavailable.

For example:
- a wireless headset, sound is handled by ALSA at the kernel-level,
battery status is monitored through another interface by the user
directly, unbinding the USB driver will disable both the sound driver
and the battery monitor
- a keyboard with RGB backlight, key presses are handled by the input
subsystem in the kernel, RGB backlight through another interface as a
normal user, unbinding the USB driver disconnects the keyboard
completely making it lose lock keys status, amongst other things
- a phone used for both network access and file access through MTP,
unbinding the USB driver will boot the computer off the network as well
as disconnecting the file access when we only wanted the latter to
happen

I'll explain those use cases in the commit message.

For those who want to reproduce the problem, tested with USB wireless
headset:
$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 011: ID 1038:12b6 SteelSeries ApS SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless

# Using the bus and device IDs
$ grep -l 001/011 /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/uevent | sed 's,/sys/bus/usb/devices/,,' | sed 's,/uevent,,'
1-10

$ echo 1-10 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind

Both the ALSA device:

and the battery script
(https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl/pull/230) are gone.
