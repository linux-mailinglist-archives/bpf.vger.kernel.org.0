That's what I was thinking for option (4) "introduce a
security_bpf_prog_unload()". Anyway, I agree. Paul brought up a good
point that he'd like to see more discussion around this idea [1].
Mucking with the mounts (see below) is a bit of a mess, and there could
still exist other methods for unloading I'm not aware of yet.

Yesterday I whipped up a hack such that: 

	mkdir -p /run/fs/bpf-lsm
	mount -t bpf none /run/fs/bpf-lsm
	./load-policies /run/fs/bpf-lsm

Where the implemented hooks inode_unlink & sb_umount look for a "bpf"
filesystem type on the struct super_block for the mount, and then check
for a xattr or UUID to hone in on _just_ that special mount point. This is
so we can still umount /sys/fs/bpf. This hack so far is working out
quite well.

xattr is still under development, thus the UUID idea (we're still exploring
unique-path-agnostic identifiers). I also didn't prove the UUID
idea yet. For instance, I wouldn't want the UUID to change on mount
--move or mount -o remount.

Apropos the reboot problem, the idea is to force a reboot for policy change
for now. And then eventually leverage xattr + IMA, or something else to prove
the loader binary + progs once these features are available. Policy
versioning is also an idea we're floating around for handling the update
case with the loader to avoid reboot.

This is all to say, I think there is a use-case here for a new hook to
simplify the unload problem at least.

P.S. This is an awesome discussion :) Thanks everyone!
