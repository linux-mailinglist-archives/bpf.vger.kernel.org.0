Are you saying that unprivileged programs are not allowed to allocate
memory?  Or that there is a limit on the amount of heap memory that
unprivileged programs are allowed to allocate.

Part of working with other people is understanding that they don't know
as much as you do about your thing, and at the same time understanding
that you don't know as much as they do about their thing.  That means
explaining things in a way which makes sense to them instead of getting
all huffy when they don't understand the details of your thing.
