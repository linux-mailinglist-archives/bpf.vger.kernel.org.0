Other than obj_cgroup_may_zswap(), there is no other place which really
need very very accurate stats. IMO we should actually make ratelimited
version the default one for all the places. Stats will always be out of
sync for some time window even with non-ratelimited flush and I don't
see any place where 2 second old stat would be any issue.

4 sec is the worst case and I don't think anyone have seen or reported
that they are seeing 4 sec delayed flush and if it is happening, it
seems like no one cares.

Sounds good to me and you might just need to check obj_cgroup_may_zswap
is not getting delayed or getting stale stats.

I don't like global sleepable locks as those are source of priority
inversion issues on highly utilized multi-tenant systems but I still
need to see how you are handling that.

Seems like another instance where we should use the ratelimited version
of the flush function.
