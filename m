Yes.

Bpf map should be deleted by a user first.

Not really. We can implement reparenting (probably objcg-based), I think it's
a good idea in general. I can take a look, but can't promise it will be fast.

In thory we can't forbid deleting cgroups with associated bpf maps, but I don't
thinks it's a good idea.

Reparenting is the best answer I have.

Thanks!
