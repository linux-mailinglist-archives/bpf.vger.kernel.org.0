I think a concrete walk-through example before/after with reg state would
be nice and some more analysis on how the change relates to the subsequent
adjustments done in __reg64_deduce_bounds() further below where we learn
from signed and later again from unsigned bounds.

(Btw, patch 1 looks good/trivial so I applied that one in the meantime.)
