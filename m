Yes to u64 for two reasons (1) this becomes UAPI and
(2) better alignment for tx_timestamp.
But I'm open to keeping it u32.

Sure, it is an implementation detail and my objections are mostly that I
don't find it as a pretty code approach that can be hard to follow.
Maybe driver developer will object and change this later if it cost too
much to increase the element size in their TX-ring queues.

Yes, that will work for me, thanks!
